# Sieve Of Eratosthenes
Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm to find prime numbers in the range 1 to n, in time complexity of `O(n*log(log(n)))` and space complexity of `O(n)`. The basic idea behind Sieve is that a number is said to be prime if it is not divisible by any of the smaller prime numbers.

## Pseudo Code:
>     sieve(int ){
>       let prime be a boolean vector, initially all set to true
>       mark 0 as false
>       mark 1 as false
>       for(i, starting from 2 till n){
>          if(prime[i] is true and i² is less then n){
>            for(j=i²,i²+i,i²+2i....till n){
>                    prime[j]=false
>              }
>            }
>          }
>        }
        
## Explanatation:
Initially we assume all numbers from 2 to n as prime and mark them true. We start traversing from 2 to n and if any number is prime then we mark all its multiple as false (composite) starting from i*i because all smaller numbers that are multiples of i necessary also have a prime factor which is less than i and are already marked false. Here we've typecasted i² to 'long long' because it can easily overflow the type 'int'.

## Source Code:
~~~cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void sieve(int n){
    //boolean type vector to keep track of prime numbers, true for prime, false for composite
    vector<bool>prime(n+1,true);       
    prime[0]=false;                    
    prime[1]=false;                   
    for(int i=2; i<=n; i++){    
        //if i'th number is prime then mark all its multiples as false(composite)
        if(prime[i] && (long long)i*i<=n){         
            for(int j=i*i; j<=n; j+=i){
                prime[j]=false;
            }
        }
    }
    //print the primes
    for(int i=0;i<n+1;i++){                     
        if(prime[i]){
            cout<<i<<" ";
        }
    }                                      
}                                          
int main(){
    //number of test cases
    int t;                                
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        int n;
        cin>>n;
        //we have to find prime numbers till "n"
        sieve(n);                         
        cout<<"\n";
    }
    return 0;
}

# Strassen's Matrix Multiplication 

Strassen algorithm, is an algorithm for matrix multiplication which is much faster than the naive/standard matrix multiplication algorithm for large matrices with a better asymptotic complexity.
To show how strassen's approach has a better time complexity, letâ€™s compare both of these algorithms along with the their implementation in C.

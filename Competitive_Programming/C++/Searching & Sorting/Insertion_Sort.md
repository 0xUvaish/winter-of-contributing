# Sorting
**Sorting** refers to ordering same type of data in an increasing and decreasing fashion according to some relationship among them.

***Example :-*** During assembly in schools students stand according to their respective heights in increasing order so that student with smallest height stand in front while student with the highest height stand at last. Here height is sorted in increasing order.

# Types Of Sorting
1) Quick Sort
2) Bubble Sort
3) Merge Sort
4) Insertion Sort
5) Selection Sort
6) Heap Sort
7) Radix Sort
8) Bucket Sort

So here we will discuss Insertion Sort.

# Insertion Sorting
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm. In this method we virtually split/divide our array into sorted and unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

<h1 align="center">  Conditional Rendering in React </h1>

## What is Conditional Rendering in React ?

React enables us to create distinct components that encapsulate their own unique behaviour depending on our requirements.Conditional Rendering in React refers to the rendering of such components based on certain conditions defined by us.Conditional Rendering works the same way conditions work in Javascript.

## Benefits of Conditional Rendering

- Performance Optimization : Conditional Rendering plays a major role to make sure the different user interfaces load faster on the frontend.
- Code Readability : Conditional Rendering makes it easier to read and understand several lines of code easily which is highly beneficial during editing and/or debugging the code.
- Single Return Statement : Using Conditional Rendering ,code in react steers clear of multiple return statements.

## Where we use conditional Rendering ?

- Where we want to render more than one component but depending on some sort of conditional logic.
- To improve the performance of the frontend in case of usage of large UI components.
- To enhance simplicity and readability when we are dealing with complex conditional logic of rendering different UI.

## Ways to implement Conditional Rendering in React

#### Example 1:Using useState

#### Example 2:Using props and if-else Statements

#### Example 3:Using inline if with logical && operator

#### Example 4:Conditional inline if-else

#### Example 5:Using switch case

#### Example 6:Using ternary operator

#### Example 7:Using Enums

#### Example 8:Using Enhanced JSX libraries like Babel

#### Preventing component from rendering

Give some example of the Conditional Rendering
also give some theory explanation with code.

This code would render the following output:

## Why Good Coding practices is necessary?

Knowing how to write code that runs efficiently is a very essential skill in Software Development.Optimizing code to be more efficient can mean making it:

- Execute faster
- Take up less space in memory/storage.

Good Coding Practices improve code quality making it consistent,maintainable and help in error reduction and modification.

## Benefits of good coding practices

- Production-Quality Code: Following good coding practices makes sure that code meets expectations for production in reliability,efficiency and other aspects.
- Clean Code: Good Coding Practices make the code readable,simple and concise.
- Modular Code: Modular production code makes the code more organized,efficient and reusable.
- Structure: Refactoring ensures that there is improvement of internal structure without changing the external functionality of the code.
- Documentation: Good Coding Practices advocate adding a relevant documentation. It is helpful for clarifying complex parts of the code and makes it easily understandable.Example:Adding a README file is a minimum requirement.
- Version Control:

- Refactoring: Refactoring is an integral part of good coding practices.It gives the developer a chance to clean and modularize the program after he/she has got it in working condition.
- Documentation: It makes the code easier to navigate,and quickly convey how and why different components of the application are used to a developer.Example: README file explains what the app does,lists it dependencies and provides sufficiently detailed

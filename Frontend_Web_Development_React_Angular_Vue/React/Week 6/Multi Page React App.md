## What is Multi Page React App ?

React Apps are structured to have a single index.html page.But sometimes we need to have more than one page/multi pages in case of a complex website.Since, React is not designed to have multiple html pages,we use multiple routes to handle multiple pages(views) and build a multi page application.Such an app is known as a Multi Page React App.

## How to create Multi Page React App ?

- When building complex user interfaces,we typically build Single Page Applications or S.P.As.In this method, there is only one initial HTML request and response.
- In Multi-Page React Applications, page(url) changes are handled by client-side(React) code.This method changes the visible content without fetching a new HTML file.

Example 1: Using Route and BrowserRouter

```javascript

```

This code would render the following output:

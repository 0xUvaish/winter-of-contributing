<h1 align="center">React's Class Components</h1>

## What are Class Components ?
These components are created using [ES6’s class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) syntax. They have some additional features such as the ability to contain logic (for example methods that handle onClick events), local state and other capabilities.

### Example

```js
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

## Create a Class Component
When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an upper case letter.

The component has to include the `extends React.Component` statement, this statement creates an inheritance to `React.Component`, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

The component also requires a `render()` method, this method returns HTML.

### For Example
Create a Class component called `Car`.

```js
class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}
```

Now your React application has a component called Car, which returns a `<h2>` element.

To use this component in your application, use similar syntax as normal HTML: `<Car />`

Now, Display the `Car` component in the "root" element:

```js
ReactDOM.render(<Car />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Why we use Class Components ?
As you explore other resources, you might find class components referred to as smart, container or stateful components.

- **Class** because they are basically classes

- **Smart** because they can contain logic

- **Stateful** because they can hold and/or manage local state

- **Container** because they usually hold/contain numerous other (mostly functional) components

### Disadvantages of using Class Components

If you ever worked with React you know that it’s always tricky to decide component type. What if you create a functional component, and need a **local state** or any **lifecycle method** to **get data** ? (`componentDidMount()`, `componentWillUnmount()` etc.) It’s annoying !!

Also, class components have downsides:

- **Confusing** (both human and machines, especially at `bind` and `this` keyword)

- **Lifecycle methods**, logic spread over different lifecycle methods

- **Hard to test** compared to functional components

- **Compiled code size** and **compile time**


*Class components have a considerably larger amount of markup. Using them excessively and unnecessarily can negatively affect performance as well as code readability, maintainability and testability.*


<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Function Components
A function component is basically a JavaScript/ES6 function that returns a React element (JSX). According to React's official docs, the function below is a valid functional component:

```js
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
Alternatively, you can also create a functional component with the arrow function definition:

```js
const Welcome = (props) => { 
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>; 
}
```

## Converting a Function to a Class

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="center">Initial (Functional) Component State</h3>

```js
function Clock(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
function tick() {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Clock date={new Date()} />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}
setInterval(tick, 1000);
```


However, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the `Clock` sets up a timer and updates the UI every second should be an implementation detail of the `Clock`.
Ideally we want to write this once and have the `Clock` update itself:

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Now, you can convert a function component like `Clock` to a class in five steps:

1. Create an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), with the same name, that extends `React.Component`.
2. Add a single empty method to it called `render()`.
3. Move the body of the function into the `render()` method.
4. Replace `props` with `this.props` in the `render()` body.
5. Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="center">Conversion to Class Component</h3>

```js
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

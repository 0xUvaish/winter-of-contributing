<h1 align="center">  Basic Hooks in React </h1>

## What are Hooks in React?

- Hooks were introduced in 16.8 version of React.
- They are basically logical,functional components that allow to access various lifecycle features of React like states without having to define a class.
- Hooks are also backward-compatible i.e. they are devoid of any breaking changes.
  Example: useState,useEffect and useReducers are some popularly known and used React Hooks.

### Some Rules of Using Hooks

### What is useState in React ?

- useState in React is a type of Hook that declares a state variable.
- It acts as a storage to preserve the value of that state during numerous function calls.
- The initial value of the state is passed as an argument to the useState Hook.
- useState returns the current state along with the function that updates it.

### When do we use useState ?

- When we want to add a state to our functional component.
- The state keeps updating its value during function calls.
- To create a piece of state without using a class component.

#### Example 1: Implementing a Counter using useState

```
//To use useState you need to import useState from react as shown below:
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

```

#### Example 2: Using Multiple State Variables and adding a Toggle Button using useState

```

import React,{useState} from "react";
function App(){
const[isRed,setRed]=useState(false);
const[count,setCount]=useState(0);

    const increment=()=>{
        setCount(count+1);
        setRed(!Red);  //toggle
    };

    return(
        <>
            <h1 style={{color=isRed?"red":""}}>Color changes</h1>
            <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
            <h1>You have clicked {count} times.</h1>
        </>
    );

};

export default App;

```

#### Example 3: Using useState In the case of an API call

```
import React,{useState} from "react";
import Tweet from "./Tweet";

function App(){
    const [users,setUsers]=useState([
        {name:"Girlscript",message:"Hello"},
        {name:"Girlscript",message:"Hello"},
        {name:"Girlscript",message:"Hello"}
    ]);

    return(
        <>
            {users.map(user=>(
                <Tweet name={user.name} message={user.message}/>
            ))}
        </>
    );
};

export default App;

```

### What is useEffect in React ?

### When do we use useEffect ?

How to implement useState and useEffect with code (also give theory explanation of the code) ?
You can take 2-3 examples of each with codes and different types to explain this etc....
and also add some more points related to this topic.

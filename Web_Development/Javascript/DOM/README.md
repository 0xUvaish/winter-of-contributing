DOM stands for Document Object Model. On loading a webpage, the browser converts the incoming HTML and CSS into a bunch of JavaScript objects that eventually represent the 
webpage. These objects represent the DOM and they can be updated to reflect changes in our webpage. The DOM allows us to combine JavaScript along with HTML and CSS to create our 
webpage. These interconnected objects represent the structure of the webpage in the form of a tree. The structure of a document is referred to as the model. At the top of this 
tree is the Document object. Thus the DOM helps us to create and manipulate documents.

# JSON
## Introduction

JSON is an acronym for JavaScript Object Notation which  is a  data-interchange format.

It was made to make easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

JSON exists as a string â€” useful when you want to transmit data across a network.

It needs to be converted to a native JavaScript object when you want to access the data.

It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.

JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript and many others. <br>
These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

Here is small example of JSON :-


`{"name":"jerry", "age":11, "intelligence":null}` 

The above example shows a object with 3 properties name, ages, intelligence in JSON format.


## Syntax
By the name we can understand that JSON is derived from Javascript objects.

It follows the following rules:
* Data is in name/value pairs 
* Data is separated by commas
* Curly braces hold objects 
* Square brackets hold arrays

 JSON, values must be one of the following data types:<br>

* a string- `{"name":"Rishabh"}`
* a number- `{"class":11}`
* an object- `{ "student:{"name":"Rishabh", "age":20, "Town":"new delhi"}}`
* an array-`{"student":["Rishabh", "Mayank", "Shruti"]}`
* a boolean-`{"life":true}`
* null-`{"middlename":null}`

## Advantages
The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects.

Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.
Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.<br>
JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects:

`JSON.parse()`

JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string:

`JSON.stringify()`

## Comparison
XML was one of the original way to recievce data from a server.

We use JSON and XML to receive data from a web server.

* JSON doesn't use end tag
* JSON is shorter
* JSON is quicker to read and write
* JSON can use arrays

The biggest difference is:
 XML has to be parsed with an XML parser. JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.<br>
 ### JSON
`{"students":[
  { "Name":"Mayank", "Age":"19" },
  { "Name":"Shruti", "Age":"15" },
  { "Name":"Rishabh", "Age":"17" }
]}`

### XML

```
<students>

    <student>
    <Name>Mayank</Name> <Age>19</Age>
    </student>

    <student>
    <Name>Shruti</Name> <Age>15</Age>
    </student>

    <student>
    <Name>Rishabh</Name> <Age>17</Age>
    </student>

 </students>
 ```
Here we can see that JSON is more precise, shorter and faster than XML.

To conclude that we use JSON industry wide to provide faster and more reliable way to transfer data from a server to different languages software.

XML is much more difficult to parse than JSON.

JSON is parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.

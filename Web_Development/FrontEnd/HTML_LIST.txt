Question: Types of List ?
Answer: There are two types of list:
1) Ordered List
2) Unordered List


Ordered List:
In ordered list orders matter. An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag and end with </li>. After all items added in list then we end ordered list with </ol>.

Syntax:

<ol>
<li>Apple</li>
<li>Mango</li>
<li>Strawberry</li>
</ol>


Unordered List:
In unordered list order doesn't matter. An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag and end with </li>. After all items added in list then we end ordered list with </ul>.

Syntax:

<ul>
<li>2 pencils</li>
<li>1 register</li>
<li>5 pens</li>
</ul>

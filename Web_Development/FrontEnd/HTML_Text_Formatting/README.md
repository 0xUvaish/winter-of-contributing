# HTML Text Formatting

HTML Text Formatting is formatting the text in different styles. HTML provides us many predefined tags that can be used to format texts without using CSS. These tags help us to highlight the texts, to make it bold, italic, subscript, superscript, underlined and many more. Some tags are only for visual appearance while some adds semantic value to the text.

* `<em>` - This tag is used to Emphasize text i.e displays the contents in Italic.
* `<mark>` - This tag is used to highlight texts.
* `<small>` - This tag is used to decrease the font size by one unit.
* `<del>` - This tag defines that the text has been deleted from the document.
* `<ins>` - This tag displays the content which is added.

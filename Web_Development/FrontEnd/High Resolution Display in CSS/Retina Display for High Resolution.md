# High Resolution Display using the Retina Imgae Concept

The Apple has introduced a display called the "Retina Display" which is much better than our normal display such as picture element Per Inch(PPI) or Dots Per Inch(DPI).
This display has high resolution power and we can easily distinguish between normal and retina display because each display vary sizes and specifications.

### Display Resolution

The display resolution of the device such as laptop monitor,smart tv is that the variety of different pixels in every space that may be displayed. ... In digital mensuration, the display resolution run in pixels per inch (PPI).

There are two types of display resolution we can define :-

1) Low Display Resolution : The display in which Pixels per inch has low value is called low display resolution .It is Less sharper as compare to high resolution.
2) High Display Resolution : The display in which Pixels per inch has higher value as compared to other is called the high display resolution and it is more clear.

### Retina Display

Retina display may be a term created by Apple to see devices and monitors that have a resolution and element density therefore high that someone is unable to recognise the individual pixels at a traditional viewing distance.Now The Apple device's display was well received and greatly improved the viewing expertise.

The simplest way to create your pictures properly seem on high-resolution Displays, like the MacBook execs "retina display" is to outline their breadth and height values as solely 1/2 what the first file is. Here is associate example of a picture that's solely victimisation 1/2 the first height and width:

```css
<style>
  img { height: 250px; width: 250px; }
</style>
<img src="coolPic500x500" alt="A most excellent picture">
```

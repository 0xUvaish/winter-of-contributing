# Transformation And Transitions:<r>
  
## CSS Transforms:<br>
By modifying the coordinate space, CSS transforms change the shape and position of the affected content without disrupting the normal document flow.
CSS supports 2D and 3D transformations.

## 2D Transformations: <br>
Using the `Transform` CSS property you can `rotate`, `scale`, `skew`, or `translate` an element.

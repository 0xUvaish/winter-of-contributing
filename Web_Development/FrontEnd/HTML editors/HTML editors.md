# HTML Editors

HTML editors are similar to word processors (such as Google Docs and Microsoft word) in that they assist you in the creation of code. An HTML editor is an application that allows you to edit HTML, which is the markup of a web page. Although any text editor may manipulate the HTML markup of a web page, modernÂ HTML editors can provide more ease and capability. Modern HTML editors can be used to design, edit and modify web pages. However, a simple text editor is preferred for learning HTML.

When you decide to create a website first question come in to mind is: **What I need to create a website?**

Every desktop or laptop has pre-installed text editor, if you're a windows user then you have **Notepad** available on your personal computer and if you're Apple user then you have **TextEdit** available on your mac.

# HTML `<button>` tag

HTML `<button>` is used to represent a clickable button. <br>

We can put different texts or tags (like `<i>`, `<strong>` etc.) within `<button>..</button>` tag, which we can't do in button created using HTML `<input>` tag. <br>

We can use `<button>` tag inside as well as outside of a HTML form on a webpage.<br>

If we use it inside a HTML form then we can make it a "Submit" button or a "Reset" button. Otherwise, if we want to use it outside HTML form then we can call any Javascript function to make it work according to our need.<br>

Let see how to use a HTML button through an example: <br>

```HTML
<button> click here </button>
```

#### Output:
<button> click here </button> <br>
<br>

HTML `<button>` supports many attributes, few of them are listed below:

| Attribute     | Value         | Description  |
| :------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|
| type          | button, submit, reset     | It specifies the type of a button |
| name      | any text      |   It specifies the name for a button |
| value | any text      |    It specifies the initial value for a button|
| form | form_id      |    It specifies, to which form button belongs|
| disabled | disabled     |    It specifies that a button should be disabled|

<br>

Above listed attributes are the attributes for `<button>` which are used commonly.
<br>

It is a good practice to specify "type" attribute of button, as it helps browser to know that which type of button is to be used. <br> <br>

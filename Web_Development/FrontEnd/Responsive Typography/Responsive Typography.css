### Responsive Typography

     Generally for text format we use pixel or em units but this units is fixed for any viewport if we set once and it does not depend on dimension of viewport. It’s been many years since viewport units were initial introduced in CSS. They’re actually “responsive length units” within the sense that their values changes anytime the browser resizes.
In this we documentry we have to learn about viewport and their units.

## View Port Units
    
       Viewport units are the relative units just like percentages and it is depend on viewport dimentions of a device and percentages are relative to the size of the parent container element.Therefore we use viewport unit as a responsive typography.

The different viewport units are:

vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width).
Here is an example that sets a body tag to 30% of the viewport's width.

body { width: 30vw; }

# What are Operators?

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Or
Operators are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands.

# What are Operands?
The values the operator works on are called operands.

Consider the expression 3 + 5 = 8. Here, 3 and 5 are called operands and + is called operator.

# Types of Operators
- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison (Relational) Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Membership Operators
- Identity Operators

## Let's discuss about Logical Operator and Comparison Operator :

## Logical Operators

Python logical operators allow us to perform logical AND, OR, and NOT operations between boolean values.
Examples:
- and(Logical AND)    If both the operands are true then condition becomes true.           
- or(Logical OR)      True if either of the operands is true
- not(Logical NOT)    Used to reverse the logical state of its operand.

#### Syntax :
- x and y
- x or y
- not x

## Comparison Operators

Comparison or relation operations are used to compare two values and determine the relation between then.
Examples: == , != , > , <  etc.
-  ==      Equal
-  !=      Not Equal
-  >       Greater than
-  <       Less than
-  >=      Greater than or equal to
-  <=      Less than or equal to

#### Syntax :
- x==y
- x!=y
- x>y
- x<y
- x>=y
- x<=y

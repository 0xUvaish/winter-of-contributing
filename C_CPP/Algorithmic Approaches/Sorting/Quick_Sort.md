# Sorting
Sorting refers to ordering data in an increasing or decreasing fashion according to some linear relationship among the data items. Sorting can be done on names, numbers and records. 

Example:- A list of cities could be sorted by population, by area, or by zip code.

# Types of sorting algorithms
There are mainly 8 types of sorting algo/techniques:-
1) Quick Sort
2) Bubble Sort
3) Merge Sort
4) Insertion Sort
5) Selection Sort
6) Heap Sort
7) Radix Sort
8) Bucket Sort

So here we will discuss Quick Sort.

# Quick Sort
QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. The name "Quick Sort" comes from the fact that, quick sort is capable of sorting a list of data elements significantly faster (twice or thrice faster) than any of the common sorting algorithms. It is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms and is based on the splitting of an array (partition) into smaller ones and swapping (exchange) based on the comparison with 'pivot' element selected. Due to this, quick sort is also called as "Partition Exchange" sort.

# Working/Algorithm For Quick Sort
--> Let's take an array of size(n) equals to 9 means it will have index number from 0 to 8 (0 to n-1). Now here we will take first element of array i.e 7 as "Pivot" element.

*NOTE*:- We can take any element as "Pivot" element.

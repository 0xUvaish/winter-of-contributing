### To write a program, it is necessary to follow some steps i.e ALGORITHM!üíØ

#### Lets talk about Algorithms and Flowcharts In C

### What is an Algorithm?
Algorithm refers to **a set of rules/instructions** that **step-by-step** define how a work is to be executed upon in order to get the expected output.
These Algorithms are language-independent i.e You can write them in rough language too!


## Characteristics of an Algorithm
- Clear and Umabiguous
- Well-defined Inputs
- Well-defined Outputs
- Finite-ness
- Feasible
- Language Independent


## How To Design an Algorithm?
- Fulfilling the pre-requisites such as **constraints,input,output** and **solution** of the problem must be considered while **solving the problem**.
- Designing the algorithm using **steps** or **flowcharts**.

### Lets us consider an easy Example: Write an algorithm for measuring 4 liter of water if only 5 liter and 3 liter jugs are available.
**(Quite Tricky But Simple! Enjoy doing üëç)**
START
Step 1: Fill the 5-liter jar.
Step 2: Empty 3 liters out of it into the 3-liter jar. 
Step 3: Discard the contents of 3-liter jar.
Step 4: Empty the 2 liters in the 5-liter jar into the 3-liter jar. 
Step 5: Fill the 5-liter jar again.
Step 6: Empty a liter from the 5-liter jar into the partially filled 3-liter jar (which has 2 liters in it).
Step 7: Discard the contents of the 3-liter jar.
Step 8: The 5 liter jar has 4 liters left out in it. 
END

**Try to make a flowchart to simplify it followed by a code!**üíØ

#### Now, to make a Flowchart, we need to learn some symbols too!


## What is a Flowchart?
Programmers often use it as a **program-planning tool** to solve a problem. It makes use of **symbols** which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing.
 
### Basic Symbols used in Flowchart Designs
- **_TERMINAL_**: The **oval symbol** indicates **Start, Stop and Halt** in a program‚Äôs logic flow.Terminal is the **first** and **last** symbols in the flowchart.
- **_Input/Output_**: A **parallelogram** denotes any function of input/output type.Program instructions that take input from input devices and  display  output  on  output  devices  are indicated with **parallelogram** in a flowchart.
- **_Processing_**: A **box** represents arithmetic instructions.All arithmetic processes such as adding, subtracting, multiplication and division are indicated by **action or process symbol**.
- **_Decision_**: **Diamond** symbol represents a decision point.Decision based operations such as yes/no question or true/false are indicated by **diamond** in flowchart.
- **_On-page Connector_**: Whenever flowchart becomes complex or it spreads over more than one page, it is useful to use connectors to avoid any confusions. It is represented by a **circle**.


## An example of a flowchart: Draw a flowchart to input two numbers from user and display the largest of two numbers

## What is a DFD(ata Flow Diagram)?
Quite similar to Flowcharts, but a **DFD** shows how data flows through a system which is processed as well.The flow of the data from an external or internal source as well as where the data will end up is shown in a **DFD**.

### NOTE:The main difference between DFD and Flowchart is that DFD is a graphical diagram that represents the data flow of a system while flowchart is a graphical diagram that represents the sequence of steps to solve a problem!üëç

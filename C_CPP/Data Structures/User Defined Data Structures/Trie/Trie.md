<h1 align="center">  Trie or Prefix Tree </h1>

Trie is a user-defined Data Structure that acts like a Multi-Way Tree. It is used to store a set of strings/paths for efficient query and insertions.

- A Trie takes a lot of strings or a lot of paths and using these paths it constructs the data structure such that the user can search or insert efficiently.
- It stores the information of the characters and the paths that they create.

## Sample Problem:

The idea is based on the fact that all positive integers can be represented as the sum of powers of 2. For example 19 can be represented as 16 + 2 + 1. Every node of the BITree stores the sum of n elements where n is a power of 2. For example, in the first diagram above (the diagram for getSum()), the sum of the first 12 elements can be obtained by the sum of the last 4 elements (from 9 to 12) plus the sum of 8 elements (from 1 to 8). The number of set bits in the binary representation of a number n is O(Logn). Therefore, we traverse at-most O(Logn) nodes in both getSum() and update() operations. The time complexity of the construction is O(nLogn) as it calls update() for all n elements.

Using binary Indexed tree also, we can perform both the tasks in O(logN) time. But then why learn another data structure when segment tree can do the work for us. Itâ€™s because binary indexed trees require less space and are very easy to implement during programming contests.

A Fenwick tree or binary indexed tree is a data structure that can efficiently update elements and calculate prefix sums in a table of numbers.a way to represent an array of numbers in an array, allowing prefix sums to be calculated efficiently.

# **Introduction to Operating System**
---
* Opreating system is a software that takes control of your machine as soon as it switched on.
* It act as an interface between user and hardware.

How does it act as an interface between user and hardware? <br>
Suppose there is no operating system and we want to type something in MS WORD 
 * Then we have to tell the computer manually that we want to type something .
 * Whatever we are writing in Word document has to be displayed on the screen for that we have to tell the hardware to display it on the screen.
 * After writing  we have to save the document for that also we have to tell the hardware where to save ,how much memory will be needed etc.<br>

So, for each and every task we have to explicitly tell the hardware what we want to do in form of codes. We have to write source code for that. Therefore, it will be very tedious task. To overcome this sitution we use operating system. Opearting system resides between user and hardware and acts as an interface between user and hardware. All the minute task which we had to do manually in absence of operating system is now done by operating system.

Examples of Operating System:<br>
<ol>
<li>Desktop- Windows, Linux, MacOS etc</li>
<li>Mobile- Android , IOS etc</li>
</ol>

Types of Operating System :-
<ol>
<li>Batch Oprating System</li>
<li>Time Sharing Oprating System</li>
<li>Distributed Oprating System</li>
<li>Network Oprating System</li>
<li>Real time Oprating System</li>
<li>Multi Programming / Processing /Tasking Oprating System etc.</li>
</ol>

Functions of Opearting System:-<br>
* It act as a interface between User and Hardware :- all the communication done between user and hardware takes place through Opearting System.

* Resource Management :- We have limited resource in our machine and there are multiple process running like chrome  ,word processor etc .Therefore we need a manager to decide which process should be using the CPU first according to priorites of the process .These all things are decided by operating system.

* Protection :- Since we have multiple applications running on a system, we have to ensure that one application does not impact other applications and system . Operating System act as manager and ensures that our system is safe from any malware.


Do we alaways need  a manager ?<br>
* There might be situations where we don't need a system software like operating system to manage everything. For example simple chips . We have a very simple processor for managing the lift i.e taking the control to move it  up and down ,in that situation we do not need an operating system to run this simple application on a simple processor .Therefore we can say that we need an operating system where things are complex and we need a manager to manage those things.

### Commonalities in operating system

1. Multiprogramming : <br>
 A single user cannot keep either the CPU or I/O device busy at all the time . This makes the system less efficient . Multiprogramming is a feature which increases CPU utilization by organizing jobs in such a way so that CPU always has one task to execute.

 2. Multitasking :<br>In multitaking , multiple task can be done at the same time For example , we can listen to songs and can browse chrome at the same time .<br>
 Task here refers to process. We can open multiple process at the same time because in multitasking all the process can co-exist in memory.

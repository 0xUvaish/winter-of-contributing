# Assignment Operators in c++

## There are mainly six type of operators in C++ which includes following:

1.Arithemetic Operators
1.Assignment  Operators
1.Relational  Operators
1.Logical     Operators
1.Bitwise     Operators
1.Other

### Here we will have brief decription about assignment operator and its use in c++ code.
Assignment operator is used for assigning values to the variables.
Its ususal syntax include variable on left side and value on right side of the operator.Moreover the value must be of same data type as of variable else 
it will be an error.

**Example**
 int   a    =  3;
 float b    =  2.6;
 char  c    =  'a';

 Here a,b and c are assigned values according to their data type with the help of assignment opearator.

### Different ways in which we can use this operator is shown below:
 
 **code**
 int a =  2;
 a+=3;
 cout<<a;

 Output: 5 

#### Here a is assigned value 5 as a will become a+3, simplified as a = a+3.

**code**
int a  = 8;
a -= 5;
cout <<a;

Output : 3

#### Here it is simplified as a = a-5 which gives output as 3.

**code**
int c = 8;
c*= 2;
cout<<c;

Output: 16;

#### Here c will become two times of its original value.
 
 **code**
 int b = 4;
 b/=2;
 cout<<b;

 Output: 2

#### Here b is assigned half of its initial value .

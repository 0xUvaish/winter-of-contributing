# Arithmetic Operators in c++

## There are mainly six type of operators in C++ which includes following:

1.Arithemetic Operators
1.Assignment  Operators
1.Relational  Operators
1.Logical     Operators
1.Bitwise     Operators
1.Other

### Here we will have brief decription about arithmetic operators. 
   
   These operators are used for performing arithmetical operations on data and variables.
   These basically includes addition,subtraction,multiplication,division and modulo operator.

   **Addition**
   This performs normal addition on the operands and give result

   code:
   int a=2;
   int b=4;
   int c= a+b;
   cout<<c;

   Output: 6

   **Subtraction**
   It performs subtraction over the numerical values

   code: 

   int a=3;
   int b=2;
   int c=a-b;
   cout<<c;

   Output: 1

  **Multiplication**
  It performs multiplication of two numbers.

  code:
  int a=3;
  int b=2;
  int c= a*b;
  cout<<c;

  Output: 6

  **Division**
  Helps in performing division over operands.Integers divided by integer will give integer but if one of number is float then result is decimal number.


  code:
  int a=12;
  int b= 6;
  int c= a/b;
  cout<<c;

  Output: 2


  **Modulo**
  It gives remainder after performing division of numbers.Moreover it can only be used with integer variables.

  code:
  int a=9;
  int b=2;
  int c=a%b;
  cout<<c;

  Output:1

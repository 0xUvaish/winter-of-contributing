# Reversing words in a String
In this program we will se the code for reverseing every word in a string.
I have commented the code for explanation of the code and logic.
## Example
 **Input**: s = "a good   example" 

 **Output**: "example good a"
## Solution


```
class Solution {
public:
   string reverseWords(string A) {   
reverse(A.begin(),A.end()); //reverse the original string
stringstream w(A);  //w comprises of all reversed words of A 
string word;
string rev_word="";  //final string to be returned

while(w>>word)
{
    reverse(word.begin(),word.end());  //reversing the word so that it comes to original form
    rev_word += word;     //storing word
    rev_word += " ";     //adding space
}

rev_word.erase(rev_word.length()-1,1); //removing the additional last space added 
return rev_word; 
}
};
```
### Time Complexity
O(n)

# Advanced Destructor Concepts

#### What is a destructor ?
  Destructors are basically used for the **deallocation of memory when object goes out of scope** and it is used for class object and it's class members. Destructor has the same name as that of class name but it's preceded with ~(tilde).     There can be only one destructor in a class.    
  There should be no return type and no parameters.

 ### Syntax for using Destructor:
 Suppose if class name is Add(),
 then
 > ~Add()

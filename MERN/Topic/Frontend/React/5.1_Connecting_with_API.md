## **How to use axios :**

It's a library that allows us to create API requests, get data,add data,delete data and then use that data in our application.
we have to first install axios in our local system with </br>
`npm install axios`

here we'll demonstrate how to use Axios with axios get, axios post, axios put and axios delete

- GET API:

```
     axios.get("/task");

```

- POST API:

```
     axios.post("/task",dataObject);

```

- PUT API:

```
     axios.put("/task/${id}",dataObject);

```

- DELETE API:

```
     axios.get("/task/${id}");

```

## **how to fetch data from an API :**

You can fetch data from database using axios from api endpoint.
axios will return a promise and we can use that to modify or use to show in our application.

Ex :

```
    axios.get("/task").then(data=>{
        console.log(data);
    })
```

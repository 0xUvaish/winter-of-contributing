<h1 align="center">How to Deploy with MongoDB Atlas</h1>


## What is MongoDB Atlas ?
MongoDB Atlas is a cloud service by MongoDB. It is built for developers who'd rather spend time building apps than managing databases. This service is available on AWS, Azure, and GCP.

It is the worldwide cloud database service for modern applications that give best-in-class automation and proven practices guarantee availability, scalability, and compliance with the foremost demanding data security and privacy standards. We can use MongoDB's robust ecosystem of drivers, integrations, and tools to create faster and spend less time managing our database.

- **Designed for developer productivity:** MongoDB Atlas moves faster with general tools to work with our data and a platform of services that makes it easy to build, secure, and extend applications that run on MongoDB.

- **Reliable for mission-critical workload:** It is built with distributed fault tolerance and automated data recovery.

- **Built for optimal performance:** It makes it easy to scale our databases in any direction. We can get more out of our existing resources with performance optimization tools and real-time visibility into database metrics.

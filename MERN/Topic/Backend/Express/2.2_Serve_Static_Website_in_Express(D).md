# Serving static website in Express

## Table of contents:
- What is a static Website?
- express.static() middleware
- Type of path: Absolute and Relative
- Use of path.join() and  __dirname and __filename
- Creating a dummy webpage and running it on localhost

### 1. What is a static website?
- A static web page is a webpage which is delievered to the user's web browser exactly as stored unlike to the dynamic webpages which are generated by the web browsers according to the user's interaction with the page.
- It has fixed content.
- It is most basic kind of website which is very easy to make.
- Each page is coded in HTML and displays the same information to every visitor.

### 2. express.static() middleware
- To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the express.static built-in middleware function in Express.The function signature is:
```
express.static(root, [options])
```
The root argument specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets.

For example, use the following code to serve images, CSS files, and JavaScript files in a directory named public:
```
app.use(express.static('public'))
```
### 3. Type of path : Absolute and Relative

#### Absolute path

The path which is provided in the root of express.static() is the absolute path.
For ex: ```app.use(express.static('public'))``` will load files of public directory like:

``` 
    http://localhost:3000/images/kitten.jpg
    http://localhost:3000/css/style.css
    http://localhost:3000/js/app.js
    http://localhost:3000/images/bg.png
    http://localhost:3000/hello.html
```
#### Relative path 
The path which is provided in the root of express.static() along with a virtual prefix(where the path does not actually exist in the file system) in app.use().
For ex: ```app.use('/relative', express.static('public'))``` will load files of public diirectory like:

```
    http://localhost:3000/relative/images/kitten.jpg
    http://localhost:3000/relative/css/style.css
    http://localhost:3000/relative/js/app.js
    http://localhost:3000/relative/images/bg.png
    http://localhost:3000/relative/hello.html
```

However, the path that you provide to the ```express.static``` function is relative to the directory from where you launch your node process. If you run the express app from another directory, itâ€™s safer to use the absolute path of the directory that you want to serve.

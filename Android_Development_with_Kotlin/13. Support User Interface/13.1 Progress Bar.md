For example, downloading a file, uploading a file on the internet etc.

There are two types of Progress Bar:
* Determinate ProgressBar
* Indeterminate ProgressBar

1. _**Determinate Progress Bar**_ shows the quantity of progress that has occurred like the (%) percentage of the file downloaded, how much data was uploaded or downloaded on the internet, etc.

We can use it by the following code in the XML file (activity_main.xml)

```
<ProgressBar
	android:id="@+id/pBar"
	style="?android:attr/progressBarStyleHorizontal"
	android:layout_width="wrap_content"
	android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

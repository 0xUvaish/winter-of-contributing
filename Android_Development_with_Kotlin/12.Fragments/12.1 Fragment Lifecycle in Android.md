Android Kotlin: 12.1 Fragment Lifecycle in Android #5217


Definitions:

Fragment - In Android, the fragment is the part of Activity which represents a portion of User Interface(UI) on the screen. Each fragment has it’s own lifecycle but due to the connection with the Activity it belongs to, the fragment lifecycle is infulenced by the activity’s lifecycle.


Fragment Lifecycle - The lifecycle of a fragment represents all the states a fragment undergoes from it's attachment to an activity to it's deattachment from the activity.


                                              
                                                    
                                                                
States/Methods of the Android Fragment Lifecycle :


1)  onAttach : The very first method to be called when the fragment has been associated with the activity. This method executes only once during the lifetime of a fragment.  

2)  onCreate() : This method initializes the fragment by adding all the required attributes and components.

3)  onCreateView() : 	System calls this method to create the user interface of the fragment. The root of the fragment’s layout is returned as the View component by this method to draw the UI.

4)  onViewCreated() : System calls this method after the views have been initialised. The data to their corresponding views is binded in this state.

5)  onActivityCreated()	: It indicates that the activity has been created in which the fragment exists. View hierarchy of the fragment also instantiated before this function call. 

6)  onStart() : The system invokes this method to make the fragment visible on the user’s device.

7)  onResume() : This method is called to make the visible fragment interactive. In simple words, the fragment gets focused to interact with users.

8)  onPause() : The counter method of onResume() where the fragment loses it's focus and is uninteractive with the user.

9)  onStop() : Method to terminate the visibility of fragment from the user’s screen. 

10)  onDestroyView() : System calls this method to clean up all kinds of resources as well as view hierarchy associated with the fragment.

11) onDestroy() : It is called to perform the final clean up of fragment’s state and its lifecycle.

12) onDetach() : The system executes this method to disassociate the fragment from its host activity.


                                              
                                                  
                                                  
  Below is the pictorial representation of the Android Fragment Lifecycle :

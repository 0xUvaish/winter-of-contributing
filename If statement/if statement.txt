# What is if statement in python

if statement is written using if keyword</br>
if condition is in multiple forms: simple if conditional , if-else conditional and if-elif conditional.<br/>
<pre>
Main Purpose is used for decision making.

# Simple if conditional statement
![alt text](If-Statement-in-Python.png)

if statement tests a particular condition; if the condition evaluates to true, a course-of-action is followed i.e a statement is executed. if the condition is false, it does nothing. 

<pre>
A=int(input("Enter no: "))<br/>
if (A>0):<br/>
  print(A," is Positive ")<br/>
print("if Statement is working")<br/>  
</pre>
In the above example A is 7 which is a positive number, so if condition will work and 7 is Positive and if Statement is working will be printed.

# if-else conditional statement

![alt text](if-else.jpg)

It test a condition and if the condition evaluates to true , it carries out statements indented below if and in case condition evaluates to false, it carries out statement indented below else.
<pre>
A = int(input("Enter First Number "))<br/>
B = int(input("Enter Second Number "))<br/>
if (A>B):<br/>
  print("A is greater than B")<br/>
else:<br/>
  print("B is greater than A")<br/>  
  </pre>
  
In the above example b is greater than A, So if will not work and only else will work, so B is greater than A will be printed.  

# if -elif Conditional Statement

Sometime we want to check a condition when control reaches else . i.e condition test in the form of else if. To serve the conditions, Python provides if-elif and if-elif-else statement.

<pre>
A= int(input("Enter First Number "))<br/>
B= int(input("Enter Second Number "))<br/>
C= int(input("Enter Third Number "))<br/>
if (A>B and A>C):<br/>
  print("A is greater than B and C")<br/>
elif (B>C):<br/>
  print("B is greater than A and C")<br/>
else:<br/>
  print("C is greater than A and B")  <br/>
 </pre>
 
In the above example B is greater than A and C, if will not work and elif will work and else will not work, So B is greater than A and C will be printed.

# Nested if Statement

Sometimes we need to test additional statement. For such situations, Python also supports nested-if form of if. A nested if is an if that has another if in its if's body or in elif's body or in its else's body.

<pre>
i = 100<br/>
if (i == 100):<br/>
    if (i < 150):<br/>
        print ("i is smaller than 150" )<br/>
    if (i < 120):<br/>
        print ("i is smaller than 120 ")<br/>
    else:<br/>
        print ("i is greater than 150 ")<br/>
     </pre>   
     
In the above example i = 100 and first if condition will work and then second if condition will work i is smaller than 150 and i is smaller than 120 will be printed.     
# Advantage
1. It makes a program robust by allowing few portion of program to run

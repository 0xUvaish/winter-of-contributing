# Linear Search and Binary Search
### What is Searching ?
**Searching in data-strucutre refers to the process of finding a desired element in set of items. The desired element is called "target". The set of items to be searched in, can be any data-structure like âˆ’ list, array, linked-list, tree or graph.**
## Linear Search :- 
**Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.**

**In the image shown above let our target element is 33 now we can start our searching from the start or from the end . Let we start our searching from start and compare element one by one if at any position any element found equal to  33 we will return 33 and if we reach the last index and our target element is not found we will print not found.**

### Here is the implementation of Linear Search
```
  #include<bits/stdc++.h>
  using namespace std;
  int main()
  { 
      int n; cin>>n;

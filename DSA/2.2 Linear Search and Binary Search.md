# Linear Search and Binary Search
### What is Searching ?
**Searching in data-strucutre refers to the process of finding a desired element in set of items. The desired element is called "target". The set of items to be searched in, can be any data-structure like âˆ’ list, array, linked-list, tree or graph.**
## Linear Search :- 
**Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.**

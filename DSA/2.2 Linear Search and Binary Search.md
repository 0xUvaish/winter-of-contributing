# <p align="center">Linear Search and Binary Search</p>
### <p align="center"> What is Searching ? </p>
**Searching in data-strucutre refers to the process of finding a desired element in set of items. The desired element is called "target". The set of items to be searched in, can be any data-structure like âˆ’ list, array, linked-list, tree or graph.**
## <p align="center"> Linear Search </p>
### Algorithm:-
**Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.**

**In the image shown above let our target element is 33 now we can start our searching from the start or from the end . Let we start our searching from start and compare element one by one if at any position any element found equal to  33 we will print element found and if we reach the last index and our target element is not found we will print not found.**

### Here is the implementation of Linear Search
``` c++
  #include<bits/stdc++.h>
  using namespace std;
  int main()
  { 
      int n; cin>>n; 
      int arr[n];
      for( int i=0 ;i<n;i++)
       cin>>arr[i];
       bool flag=false;
       int target_element;  cin>>target_element;
       
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
       {
            if(arr[i]==target_element)
              {   
                  cout<<"element found";
                    flag=true;
               }
        }
        if(!flag)
        cout<<"element not found";
    }
 ```
### Time Complexity of Linear Search.

**Best Case :-**   The element being searched may be found at the first position.In this case, the search terminates in success with just one comparison.Thus in best case, linear search algorithm takes O(1) operations.

**Average and Worst Case :-**  In the worst possible case,The element being searched may be present at the last position or not present in the array at all.In the former case, the search terminates in success with n comparisons.In the later case, the search terminates in failure with n comparisons.Thus in worst case, linear search algorithm takes O(n) operations.

 ## <p align="center">Binary Search </p> 
 **Binary Search is one of the fastest searching algorithms.It is used for finding the location of an element in a linear array.It works on the principle of divide and conquer technique.**
 
 **Note Point :- Binary Search Algorithm can be applied only on Sorted arrays. So, the elements must be arranged in-**  
 **1. Either ascending order if the elements are numbers.**  
 
 **2. Or dictionary order if the elements are strings.**  
 
 ### Algorithm:-  
 
 **Binary Search Algorithm searches an element by comparing it with the middle most element of the array.** **Then, following three cases are possible-**  

**Case-01 :-  If the element being searched is found to be the middle most element, its index is returned.**  

**Case-02 :-  If the element being searched is found to be greater than the middle most element, then its search is further continued in the right sub array of the middle most element.**  

**Case-03 :- If the element being searched is found to be smaller than the middle most element, then its search is further continued in the left sub array of the middle most element. This iteration keeps on repeating on the sub arrays until the desired element is found or size of the sub array reduces to zero.**

### Here is the implementation of Binary Search
```c++
 #include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

  int binarysearch(int arr[], int l ,int h,int target)
  {
        if(l<=h)
        {
              int mid = (l+h)/2;
            
              if(arr[mid]==target)
               return mid;
              if( arr[mid]>target)
                 h=mid-1;
              if( arr[mid]<target)
                   l=mid+1;
           return binarysearch(arr,l,h,target);
        }
        return -1;
  }

int main()
{
     int n,target; cin>>n>>target;
     int arr[n];
     for( int i=0;i<n;i++)
       cin>>arr[i];
     
     int ans =  binarysearch(arr,0,n-1,target);
     if(ans!=-1)
     cout<<"The element "<< target<<" found at index "<< ans<<endl;
     else
     cout<<"Element not found"<<endl;

} 
```

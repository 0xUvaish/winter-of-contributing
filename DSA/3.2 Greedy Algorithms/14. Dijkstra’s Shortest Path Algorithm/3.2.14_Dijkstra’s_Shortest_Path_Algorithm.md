# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Introduction:
This algorithm is best-known for single Source shortest path problem. 
It is applicable for both undirected and directed graphs with non-negative weights.

It is type of greedy strategy. We need to create a shortest path tree. 
It was created by computer scientist Edsger W.Dijikstra in 1956 and published in 1959.

##### In this document we look into its working and technique.

## Working:

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths to a graph's vertices in order of their distance from a given source.

* Firstly, we need to find the shortest path from the source to a vertex nearest to it, then to second nearest and so on.
* In general, before its i'th iteration begins, the algorithm has already identified the shortest paths to i-1 other vertices nearest to the source.
  
 These vertices, the source, and the edges of the shortest paths leading to them from the subtree Ti of graph.  
* To find the next vertex nearest to the source, we need to look into adjacent vertices of Ti. 
Since all the edge weights are nonnegative, it become easier to find.
* **Fringe vertices:** The set of vetrtices in Ti can be referred to as "Fringe vertices". 
They are the references, from which Dijkstra's algorithm selects the next vertex nearest to source.
* To identify the i'th nearest vertex, the algorithm computes, for every fringe vertex u, 
the sum of the distance to the nearest tree vertex v and then selects
the vertex with smallest such sum. 

The fact that it suffice to compare the lengths of such special paths is the central insight of Djkstra's algoritm.   
* The Dijkstra's algorithm selects the lightest and closest vertex in V-S to add to set S, so it is known as greedy strategy. 

Greedy strategies do not always yeild optimal results in general. But here we can find the right path. 


## To facilitate the algorithm's operations, we label each vertex with two labels.
  * The numeric label d: Which indicates the length of the shortest path from the source to vertex found by the algorithm so far; 
    
    when a vertex is added to the tree, d indicates the length of the shortest path from source to that vertex.
  * Second label: It describes the name of the next-to-last vertex on such a path i.e, the parent of the vertex in the tree being constructed.
  * With such labeling, finding the next nearest vertex u* becomes a simple task of finding a fringe vertex with smallest d value. Ties can be 
broken arbitrarily.
  * When we finish identifying a vertex u* to be added to the tree, we need to perform remaining two operations:
    * Move u* from the fringe to the set of tree vertices.
for each remaining fringe vertex u that is connected to u* by an edge of weight w(u*, u) such that du*+w(u*,u)<du,
    * update the labels of u by u* and du*+w(u*,u), respectively.

## Let's understand this with example:
![img](https://slidetodoc.com/presentation_image_h/cff5a1f9a4979aeb0397430c1f3a8af1/image-7.jpg)

In above example, we need to find all the shortest paths. Let's look it into this way; 

Assume vertex B is Bangaluru and F is Delhi. We can go from B to A directly. But
B to F has many ways. Some are lengthy, in some roads are not good etc. We need to find the route from which we reach the destination easily. 

Assume the weights are time taken for covering that particular route. Here the Dijkstra's algorithm comes in.
In above table it is clearly explained as working of algorithm is explained in documentation.

## Algorithm
```
	//Input: A weighted connected graph G={V,E} with nonnegative weights and its vertex s
	//Output:The length d of a shortest path from s to v and its ultimate vertex pv for every vertex v in V
        Initialize(Q)	//Initialize priority queue to empty
	for every vertex v in V
		d<- ∞  ; pv<-null
		Insert(Q,v,d)  	//Initialize vertex priority in the priority queue
	ds<- 0;	Decrese(Q,s,ds)	//Update priority of s with ds
	Vt<- ∅;
	for i<-0 to |V|-1 do
	u*<-DeleteMin(Q)	//Delete the minimum priority element
	Vt<- Vt ∪ {u*}
	for every vertex u in V-Vt that is adjacent to u* do
		if du*+w(u*,u);  pu<-u*
			Decrease(Q,u,du)

```


## Time complexity analysis:
* The complexity of this algorithm depends on  data structure used for implementing the queue and for representing an input of graph. 
* For graphs represented by adjacecy lists and the priority queue implemented as a min-heap, it is in O(|E| log|V|).


## Applications:

* Transportation planning and packet routing in communication networks, including the Internet.
* Finding shortest paths in social networks, speech recognition, document formatting robotics, compilers, and airline crew scheduling.

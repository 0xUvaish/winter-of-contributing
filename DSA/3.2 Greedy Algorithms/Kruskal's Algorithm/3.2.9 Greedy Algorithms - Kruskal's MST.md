<h1 align ="center"> KRUSKAL'S ALGORITHM</h1><br>

Kruskal’s Algorithm is a famous greedy algorithm which is used for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given graph. To apply Kruskal’s algorithm, the graph must be <b> weighted</b>, <b>connected</b> and <b>undirected</b>.

## IMPLEMENTATION

- <b>STEP 1:</b> Sort all the edges from low weight to high weight.
- <b>STEP 2:</b> Take the edge with the lowest weight and use it to connect the vertices of graph. If adding an edge creates a cycle, then reject that edge and go for the next least weight edge.
- <b>STEP 3:</b> Keep adding edges until all the vertices are connected and a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is obtained.

## TIME COMPLEXITY

Worst case time complexity of Kruskal’s Algorithm is:<br>

```C
O(ElogV) OR O(ElogE)
```

#### Analysis

- The edges are maintained as min heap.
- The next edge can be obtained in O(logE) time if graph has E edges.
- Reconstruction of heap takes O(E) time.
- So, Kruskal’s Algorithm takes O(ElogE) time.
- The value of E can be at most O(V2).
- So, O(logV) and O(logE) are same.

#### Exceptional Case

- If the edges are already sorted, then there is no need to construct minimum heap.
- So, deletion from minium heap time is saved.
- In this case, time complexity of Kruskal’s Algorithm = <b>O(E + V)</b>

## SOLUTION

To construct MST using Kruskal’s Algorithm: <br>
<b>1. </b>Simply draw all the vertices on the paper.<br>
<b>2. </b>Connect these vertices using edges with minimum weights such that no cycle gets formed.<br>

Since all the vertices have been connected / included in the MST, so we stop.

### Weight of the MST:

```C
= Sum of all edge weights
= 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 9
= 37 units
```

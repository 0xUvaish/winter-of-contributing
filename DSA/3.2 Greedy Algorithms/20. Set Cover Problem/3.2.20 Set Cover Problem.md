# Set Covering Problem
The set cover problem is a classical question in combinatorics, computer science, operations research and complexity theory. It is one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems shown to be NP-complete in 1972. It is a problem whose study has led to the development of fundamental techniques for the entire field of approximation algorithms.<br>
There are two types of this problem. One is the decision problem and another is the optimization problem. The decision version of set covering is <b>NP-complete</b> while the optimization version of set covering is <b>NP-hard</b>.

## Problem Description

### Input
Given a Universe of n elements U = { u<sub>1</sub> , u<sub>2</sub> , ... , u<sub>n</sub> }, A collection of subsets of U say S = { S<sub>1</sub> , S<sub>2</sub> , ... , S<sub>k</sub> } where each subset has an associated cost C = { c<sub>1</sub> , c<sub>2</sub>, ... , c<sub>k</sub> }

### Goal
Find a minimum cost subcollection of S that covers all elements of U.

In the un-weighted Set Cover Problem, c<sub>j</sub> = 1 for all j . If each set is assigned a cost, it becomes a weighted set cover problem.

### Approach
There is no polynomial time solution available for this problem as the problem is a known NP-Hard problem. But there is a polynomial time Greedy approximate algorithm which can not give correct result in all cases but will give an approximate result in most cases.This algorithm provides a Log(n) approximation.

### Greedy Approximation Algorithm
1) Let I represents set of elements included so far.  Initialize I = { }
2) Do following while I is not same as U. <br>
    a) Find the set S<sub>i</sub> in {S<sub>1</sub> , S<sub>2</sub> , ... , S<sub>m</sub>} whose cost effectiveness is smallest, i.e., the ratio of cost C(S<sub>i</sub>) and number of newly added elements is minimum. Basically we pick the set for which following value is minimum Cost(S<sub>i</sub>) / |S<sub>i</sub> - I| <br>
    b) Add elements of above picked S<sub>i</sub> to I, i.e.,  I = I U S<sub>i</sub>

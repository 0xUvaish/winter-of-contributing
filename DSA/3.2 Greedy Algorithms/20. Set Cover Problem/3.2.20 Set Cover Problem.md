# Set Covering Problem
The set cover problem is a classical question in combinatorics, computer science, operations research and complexity theory. It is one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems shown to be NP-complete in 1972. It is a problem whose study has led to the development of fundamental techniques for the entire field of approximation algorithms.

There are two types of this problem. One is the decision problem and another is the optimization problem. The decision version of set covering is NP-complete while the optimization version of set covering is NP-hard.

## Problem Description

### Input
Ground elements or Universe U = { u<sub>1</sub> , u<sub>2</sub> , ... , u<sub>n</sub> } <br>
Subsets : S<sub>1</sub> , S<sub>2</sub> , ... , S<sub>k</sub> ⊆ U <br>
Costs : c<sub>1</sub> , c<sub>2</sub>, ... , c<sub>k</sub>

### Goal
Find a set I ⊆ { 1 , 2 , ... , m } that minimizes ∑c<sub>i</sub> where i∈I such that U S<sub>i</sub> where i∈I = U .

In the un-weighted Set Cover Problem, c<sub>j</sub> = 1 for all j .

If each set is assigned a cost, it becomes a weighted set cover problem.


k; the question is whether there is a set covering of size 
k
k or less. In the set covering optimization problem, the input is a pair 
(
U
,
S
)
({\mathcal {U}},{\mathcal {S}}), and the task is to find a set covering that uses the fewest sets.

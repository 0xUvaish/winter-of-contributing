# **Square Root Decomposition**

## **What is Square Root Decomposition technique**
    Sqrt Decomposition is a method (or a data structure) that allows you to perform some common operations (finding sum of the elements of the sub-array, finding the minimal/maximal element, etc.) in O(√n) operations, which is much faster than O(n) for the trivial algorithm.

## **Explanation of algorithm**
    The basic idea of sqrt decomposition is preprocessing. We'll divide the array a into blocks of length approximately √n, and for each block i we'll precalculate the sum of elements in it b[i].
    
    We can assume that both the size of the block and the number of blocks are equal to √n rounded up:
                                                s = ⌈√n⌉

    The last block may have fewer elements than the others (if n not a multiple of s), it is not important to the discussion (as it can be handled easily).

    So, we have calculated the values of b[k] (this required O(n) operations). How can they help us to answer each query [l, r]? Notice that if the interval [l, r] is long enough, it will contain several whole blocks, and for those blocks we can find the sum of elements in them in a single operation. As a result, the interval [l, r] will contain parts of only two blocks, and we'll have to calculate the sum of elements in these parts trivially.

    Thus, in order to calculate the sum of elements on the interval [l, r] we only need to sum the elements of the two "tails": [l…(k+1) ⋅ s−1] and [p ⋅ s…r].

    Note: When k = p, i.e. l and r belong to the same block, the formula can't be applied, and the sum should be calculated trivially.

    This approach allows us to significantly reduce the number of operations. Indeed, the size of each "tail" does not exceed the block length s, and the number of blocks in the sum does not exceed s. Since we have chosen s≈√n, the total number of operations required to find the sum of elements on the interval [l, r] is O(√n).

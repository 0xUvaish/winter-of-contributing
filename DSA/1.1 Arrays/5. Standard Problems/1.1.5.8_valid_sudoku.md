# Problem Statement
```
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
```
### Constraints
```
board.length == 9
board[i].length == 9
board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.
```
## Example 1
### Input
```
board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```
### Output
```
true
```
### Explanation
```
An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different.
Here,both s = "anagram", t = "nagaram" have same characters occuring same number of times,hence s and t are anagrams.
```
## Example 2
### Input
```
board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```
### Output
```
false
```
### Explanation
```
Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

## Algorithm
1. Check both string's length,if its not equal return false as number of characters must be same for anagrams.
2. Initialize an array of length 256 with all elements 0,as maximum possible characters is equal to 256.
3. Traverse the strings,increment the value of element present at the ascii value of particular character by 1,in case of strings s and decrement by 1 in case of string t.
4. If s and t are anagrams,at end all elements of the array will be 0.If it is like this,return true otherwise return false.
## Code

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
       
       if(s.length()!=t.length())   //Check whether both strings of same length or not
           return false;
        int count[256]={0};
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
        {
            count[s[i]]++;       //Increment the occurence of integer equal to ASCII value of element of string s 
            count[t[i]]--;      //Decrement the occurence of integer equal to ASCII value of element of string t
        }
        for(int i=0;i<256;i++)
        {
            if(count[i])        //Element other than 0
                return false;
            
        }
        return true;
    }
    
};
        
    

```
## Time Complexity
Time complexity will be O(length of string) i.e. O(n).

## Space Complexity
We are not using new array of length 256,Space Complexity will be O(length of array) i.e. O(n).

A database is a collection of related data. By data, we mean known facts that can be recorded  and  that  have  implicit  meaning. 
```
- For example, consider the names, tele-phone numbers, and addresses of the people you know. You may have recorded 
this data in an indexed address book or you may have stored it on a hard drive, using apersonal computer and 
software such as Microsoft Access or Excel. 
```
- This collection of related data with an implicit meaning is a database. The preceding definition of database is quite general; 
For example, we may considerthe collection of words that make up this page of text to be related data and hence toconstitute  a  database. 

- However, the  common  use  of  the  term  databaseis  usually more restricted. 
- A database has the following implicit properties:
<br>
■ A  database  represents  some  aspect  of  the  real  world, sometimes  called  theminiworldor the universe of discourse (UoD). Changes 
to the miniworldare reflected in the database.
<br>

■ A  database  is  a  logically coherent  collection  of  data  with  some  inherentmeaning. A random assortment of data cannot correctly be 
referred to as adatabase.
<br>

■ A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose.It  has  an  intended  group  of  users  and  some  preconceived  
applications  inwhich these users are interested.In other words, a database has some source from which data is derived, some degreeof interaction 
with events in the real world, and an audience that is actively interested in its contents. 

-   A database  can  be  of any  size  and  complexity. For  example, the  list  of names  andaddresses referred to earlier may consist of only a few 
hundred records, each with asimple  structure. 
-   A database may be generated and maintained manually or it may be computerized.For example, a library card catalog is a database that may be created 
and maintainedmanually. A  computerized  database  may  be  created  and  maintained  either  by  agroup  of  application  programs  written  specifically  
for  that  task  or  by  a  databasemanagement  system. 

- A database management system (DBMS)is a collection of programs that enablesusers to create and maintain a database. The DBMS is a general-purpose software sys-temthat 
facilitates the processes ofdefining, constructing, manipulating,andsharingdatabases among various users and applications.Defininga database involves spec-ifying the 
data types, structures, and constraints of the data to be stored in the data-base. The database definition or descriptive information is also stored by the DBMSin the 
form of a database catalog or dictionary; it is called meta-data.Constructingthe database is the process of storing the data on some storage medium that is con-trolled by 
the DBMS.Manipulatinga database includes functions such as queryingthe database to retrieve specific data, updating the database to reflect changes in the miniworld, and 
generating reports from the data.Sharinga database allows multi-ple users and programs to access the database simultaneously.An application  programaccesses  the  database  
by  sending  queries  or  requests  fordata  to  the  DBMS.  A  query2typically  causes  some  data  to  be  retrieved;  atransactionmay cause some data to be read and some 
data to be written into thedatabase.
- Other important functions provided by the DBMS include protectingthe databaseandmaintainingit over a long period of time.Protectionincludessystem protectionagainst  hardware  
or  software  malfunction  (or  crashes)  and  security  protectionagainst  unauthorized  or  malicious  access. A  typical  large  database  may  have  a  lifecycle of many 
years, so the DBMS must be able to maintainthe database system byallowing the system to evolve as requirements change over time.It is not absolutely necessary to use 
general-purpose DBMS software to implementa  computerized  database. We  could  write  our  own  set  of  programs  to  create  andmaintain the database, in effect creating 
our own special-purposeDBMS software. Ineither case—whether we use a general-purpose DBMS or not—we usually have todeploy a considerable amount of complex software. In fact, 
most DBMSs are verycomplex software systems.

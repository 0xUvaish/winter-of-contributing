## Purpose of Retrieving Images

Retrieving Images using Machine Learning Algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks have been one of the most great development in the technical domain. Image Retrieving models can be widely used to classify and differentiate Images on the basis of color, texture, theme, etc. They are used in apps for finding similiar accesories, dresses, etc. An image retrieval system is a computer system used for browsing, searching and retrieving images from a large database of digital images.

## Image Retrieval using CNN

We use Convolutional Neural Network to train our model after going through different phases, which are helpul in increasing accuracy of our model. <br>
Feature Detectors and Pooling are used to filter important features and try to capture useful information just like human beings. Then, they are passed to Fully Connected Layers for further processing.<br>
Fully Connected layers are Artificial_Neural_Networks(ANN) which relies on inputs and their weights to classify or retrieve images based on their previous training.

Basically, there are two types of Image Retrieval -
- Text Based Image Retrieval
- Content Based Image Retrieval

Also, both Text Based and Content Based Image Retrieval are combined for getting better results while searching or browsing through Internet or whether it is related to Medical Domain. Below is a chart representing use of Image retrieval framework in Medical Domain

Using Convolutional Neural Networks, we have to train our model such that it classifies Images correctly on which it is trained. And also classifies all those Images which are not part of training but part of classification output. This is perfect example of Deep Learning and Unsupervised Approach.

## Image Retrieval using CNN

Basically, there are two types of Image Retrieval -
- Text Based Image Retrieval
- Content Based Image Retrieval

We use Convolutional Neural Network to train our model after going through different phases, which are helpul in increasing accuracy of our model. <br>
Feature Detectors and Pooling are used to filter important features and try to capture useful information just like human beings. Then, they are passed to Fully Connected Layers for further processing.<br>
Fully Connected layers are Artificial_Neural_Networks(ANN) which relies on inputs and their weights to classify or retrieve images based on their previous training.

:star: Harris Corner Detection

:stars: Introduction
The Harris Corner Detector is a mathematical operator that finds features (what are features?) in an image. It is simple to compute, and is fast enough to work on computers. Also, it is popular because it is rotation, scale and illumination variation independent. However, the Shi-Tomasi corner detector, the one implemented in OpenCV, is an improvement of this corner detector.

To define the Harris corner detector, we have to go into a bit of math. We'll get into a bit of calculus

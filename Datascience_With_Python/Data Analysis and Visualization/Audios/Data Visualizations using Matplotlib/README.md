# Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualisation package based on NumPy arrays and intended to operate with the SciPy stack as a whole. Matplotlib's ability to work with a wide range of operating systems and graphics backends is one of its most essential characteristics. Matplotlib supports a wide range of backends and output formats, so you can rely on it to operate independent of your operating system or desired output format. One of Matplotlib's greatest virtues has been its cross-platform, everything-to-everyone approach. It has attracted a significant user base, which has resulted in an active developer community, as well as Matplotlib's sophisticated capabilities and widespread use in the scientific Python community.

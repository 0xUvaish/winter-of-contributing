## INFORMATION ABOUT DATASET

To share my understanding of the concept and techniques I know,Iâ€™ll take an example of Haberman Cancer Survival  dataset which is available on kaggle(link provided in important link section) and try to catch hold of as many insights from the dataset using EDA.

## DESCRIPTION

The data set contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

## AIM
In this documentation, we understood the meaning of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with the help of an example dataset. We looked at how we can analyze the dataset, draw conclusions from the same, and form a hypothesis based on that.

#### Platform used for dataset: Google Colab
#### Imported Libraries: 
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Pandas

# Data Science with Python : Markov's Chain #377 

## Description and Overview

A statistical system in which occurrence of future state is entirely dependent only on the immediately preceding state, is called Markov chain.
In the tutorial we have discussed the definition, types and representation of a vary basic 2-state Markov chain .

## Assumptions:

1. The statistical system contains finite number of states.
2. The states are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.
3. The transition probability from one state to another state is constant over time.

We have learnt to code our simple Markov chain from scratch. Markov chain is a useful tool for many more complex stochastic models which are used in various fields such as physics, statistics, signal processing, speech recognition and many more.

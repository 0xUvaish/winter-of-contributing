## What is R-squared?

R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. 

It is the percentage of the response variable variation that is explained by a linear model.

It is also called a coefficient of determination, or coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression.

## What is Mean Squared Error?

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Squared Deviation (MSD) of an estimator measures the average of error squares i.e., the average squared difference between the estimated values and true value. 

It is a risk function, corresponding to the expected value of the squared error loss. 

It is always non â€“ negative and values close to zero are better. 

The MSE is the second moment of the error (about the origin) and thus incorporates both the variance of the estimator and its bias.

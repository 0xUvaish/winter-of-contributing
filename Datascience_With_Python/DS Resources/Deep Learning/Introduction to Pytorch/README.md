# Introduction to Pytorch 
## What is PyTorch?
#### It’s a Python based package for serving as a replacement of Numpy and to provide flexibility as a Deep Learning Development Platform.
## Why PyTorch?
*I encourage you to read Fast AI’s blog post for the reason of the course’s switch to PyTorch.
Or simply put:*
* Dynamic Graphs
* More intuitive than TF (Personal View)

## Pros and Cons of PyTorch and TensorFlow
### TENSORFLOW PROS:
* Simple built-in high-level API.
* Visualizing training with Tensorboard.
* Production-ready thanks to TensorFlow serving.
* Easy mobile support.
* Open source.
* Good documentation and community support.
### TENSORFLOW CONS:
* Static graph.
* Debugging method.
* Hard to make quick changes.
### PYTORCH PROS:
* Python-like coding.
* Dynamic graph.
* Easy & quick editing.
* Good documentation and community support.
* Open source.
* Plenty of projects out there using PyTorch.
 
### PYTORCH CONS:
* Third-party needed for visualization.
* API server needed for production.

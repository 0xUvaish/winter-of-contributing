**Why to create Dummy Variables?**

- Conversation of categorical data to numeric data.
- Many of the model in data mining treats or computes the dataset when all the datatype is in numeric.

**Methods that are used to convert:**

- *Label encoder:* Label Encoding refers to converting the labels into a numeric form so as to convert them
into the machine-readable form.

- *One- hot encoding:* A one hot encoding is a representation of categorical variables as binary vectors. 
This first requires that the categorical values be mapped to integer values.

**Adavtages:**
- Converts the categorical data to numeric which makes easily understandable by ml algorithms.

**Disadvantage:**
- Might impact on size if it has more categories in the dataset which results in increasing the complexity.

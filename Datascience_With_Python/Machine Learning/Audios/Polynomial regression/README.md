**Polynomial Regression:**
- Polynomial Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm.
- It is the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables as nth degree
polynomial.
- Equation:

y= b0 + b1 x1^1 + b2 x1^2 + b3 x1^3 +......+ bn x1^n

**Why do we use Polynomial regression?**
- Polynomial regression is a special type of multiple linear regression.
- Multiple linear regression is converted to polynomial regression by adding the polynomial terms to 
the linear equation.
- It is a linear model with some modification in order to increase the accuracy.
- When data points are arranged in a non-linear fashion, we need the Polynomial Regression model.

**Advantages:**
- Model accuracy is increases.
- For non-linear data points we can draw the best fit line.

**Disadvantages:**
- Model complexity increases.
- Training time increases.
- In some cases, it might lead to overfitting for the data values

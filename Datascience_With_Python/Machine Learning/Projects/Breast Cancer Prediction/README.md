# ML Breast Cancer Prediction
Its an Machine Learning Model for Breast Cancer Prediction.
<br/>
Created a Machine Learning Model to predict the Breast Cancer by analyzing the factors and variables given in the Dataset.<br/>
Compared 4 Machine Learning models predictions by creating a dataframe and entering the accuracy score and the respective machine learning model.

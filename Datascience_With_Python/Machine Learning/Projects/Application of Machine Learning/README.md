# :dart: Application of Machine Learning

## :nazar_amulet: Objective
To collect application of AI and connect them with machine learning algorithm

## :nazar_amulet: Introduction
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

Some Applications of ML are:

:stars: House Price Prediction using Regression

:stars: Face mask Detection using CNN

:stars: Email spam Detector

:stars: Fingerprint Recognition using YOLOV3.

In this documentation , we are gonna see basic Regression ML model

1 - Data Collection.

2 - Data Preparation.

3 - Choose a Model.

4 - Train the Model.

5 - Evaluate the Model.

6 - Parameter Tuning.

7 - Make Predictions.

using this, many ML models can be implemented.

## :nazar_amulet: CONCLUSION:
Nowadays, Machine Learning (ML) is an exciting major of research in computer science and engineering. Also, it is used in various areas and fields in real-life during these days such as finance, CRM, self-driving cars, business intelligence, and so on. In fact, Machine Learning allows software to become accurate in predicting outcomes.

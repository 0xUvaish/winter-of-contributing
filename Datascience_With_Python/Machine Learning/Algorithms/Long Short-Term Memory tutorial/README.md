# Long Short Term Memory

It is difficult and time-consuming for everything to start from scratch. A similar example is while reading this Documentation you try to understand the meaning based on the previous words. You don't forget as soon as you read a sentence and start from scratch to undertstand the meaning. You persist the understandings.

Considering the above statements and relating with traditional neural networks, they cannot implement this as they propogate and can have either the previous or only one major thing in their memory.

To overcome this disadvantage Recurrent Neural Network comes handy. They are networks with loops in them, allowing information to persist for a longer time (say until the program execution).

# **Random Forest Algorithm**

## **Introduction**

- A random forest is a machine learning technique that’s used to solve regression and classification problems. It utilizes ensemble learning, which is a technique that combines many classifiers to provide solutions to complex problems.

- We will understand the working of this algorithm by a project example by following steps as below:

 1. Data Preprocessing with Visualization.
 2. Model Building

## **Purpose** 

The (random forest) algorithm establishes the outcome based on the predictions of the decision trees. It predicts by taking the average or mean of the output from various trees. Increasing the number of trees increases the precision of the outcome.

## **Features**

- It’s more accurate than the decision tree algorithm.

- It provides an effective way of handling missing data.

- It can produce a reasonable prediction without hyper-parameter tuning.

- It solves the issue of overfitting in decision trees.

- In every random forest tree, a subset of features is selected randomly at the node’s splitting point.


## **Brief summary** 

A decision tree consists of three components: decision nodes, leaf nodes, and a root node. A decision tree algorithm divides a training dataset into branches, which further segregate into other branches. This sequence continues until a leaf node is attained. The leaf node cannot be segregated further.

## **Conclusion**

- The rain forest algorithm is a machine learning algorithm that is easy to use and flexible. It uses ensemble learning, which enables organizations to solve regression and classification problems.

- This is an ideal algorithm for developers because it solves the problem of overfitting of datasets. It’s a very resourceful tool for making accurate predictions needed in strategic decision making in organizations.

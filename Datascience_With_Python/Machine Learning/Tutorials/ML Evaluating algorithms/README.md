# **Evaluation of Algorithms**

Evaluating our Algorithm is an essential part of any project.Once we defined our problem and prepared data we need to apply machine learning algorithm to the data in order to solve our problem.

We spend lot of time choosing, running and tuning algorithmd.We have to make sure, we are using our time effectively to get closer to solve our goal.


Evaluation of an Algorithms includes 3 steps:

**1. Test the Harness:**

We need to run a test harness to check the effectiveness of our particular answer, think deeply and make insightful interpretations about the problem. The estimation of the problem set by applying various algorithms to it will  make for a better harness.The quick insight into the learnability of the problems will indicate whether we should carry on the problem and its evaluation further.This implies the beneficial structure of the problem which can be easily read and learned by the machine. Test Harness is also used for cross-validation to estimate the working effectiveness of the chosen algorithm.

A test harness provides a consistent way to evaluate machine learning algorithms on a dataset.

It involves 3 elements:

1.The resampling method to split-up the dataset.

2.The machine learning algorithm to evaluate.

3.The performance measure by which to evaluate predictions.

The loading and preparation of a dataset is a prerequisite step that must have been completed prior to using the test harness.

The test harness must allow for different machine learning algorithms to be evaluated, whilst the dataset, resampling method and performance measures are kept constant.

**2.Explore and select algorithms:**

A better algorithm will always put forward an easy way to solve a problem.Classification, regression analysis, and clustering are some of the methods which help to create meaningful results. It is not that challenging to find a good performance measure.

It includes few steps to select an algorithm

1.Categorize the problem

2.Understand Your Data

3.Find the available algorithms

4.Implement machine learning algorithms.

5.Optimize hyperparameters

**3.Interpret and report results:**

After choosing an algorithm based on various parameters, it is always useful to test it and see the structure it generates and whether the machine is capable of learning and analyzing the given dataset and its provided structure. Spot checking is one of the ways to do that. 

Instead of testing the whole data we may use a proportion of the whole data and divide it among testing and training. The sample should be a good representative of your population. It is not necessary to train the entire model on the given dataset.

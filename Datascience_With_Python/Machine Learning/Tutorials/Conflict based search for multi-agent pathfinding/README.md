<h1 align="left">Conflict based search for optimal multi-agent pathfinding</h1>

## Description:
# **Multi-Agent path finding:**
> Multi-agent path finding or in short refered to as MAPF is a problem for finding paths which are collision or obstacle free for a given set of agents.

# **Conflict based search:**

>Conflict based search or in short refered to as CBS is a multi-agent path finding algorithm.  CBS is a continuum of coupled and decoupled approaches.The uniqueness of CBS is that all low-level
searches are performed as single-agent searches. The performance of CBS depends on the structure of the problem.

<b>What are itemsets and frequent itemsets?</b><br>
When different kinds of items together form a set, it is called an itemset. If it contains k different types of items, then it is precisely called 'k-itemset'.When in a certain amount of transactions, a particular itemset is occuring frequently, it is called a frequent itemset.<br>
Now the question arises, how can we know if an itemset is occuring frequently? This is measured with the help of a quantity termed as "Minimum support threshold".
If number of occurance of an itemset is greater than or equal to this specified threshold, it is said to be occuring frequently.<br><br>

<b>What does Apriori algorithm do?</b><br>
Apriori algorithm discovers relation between different items in a dataset.It checks on which items together are forming strong association rules and hence can be called frequet itemsets. This result is useful for many real world problems including market basket analysis,health pattern identification, recommendation systems etc.<br><br>

<b>Important terms</b><br>
There are a few terms that we have to be familiar with before proceeding to understand the algorithm.They are listed here:<br>

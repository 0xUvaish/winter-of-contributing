## **What is Hierarchical Clustering?**

- Hierarchical clustering, also known as hierarchical cluster analysis, is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters.
- The output is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.

**The Hierarchical Clustering can be dived into 2 types:**
1. Agglomerative
2. Divisive

#  Music Recommendation Systems
# Introduction
The number of songs which are available exceeds the listening
capacity of an individual in their lifetime. It is tedious for an
individual to sometimes choose from millions of songs and
there is also a good chance of missing out on songs which
could have been the apt for the occasion.
These days all effort and research is going in predicting the
kind of songs that a particular user will like, using their entire
song history. Here, people are trying to recommend songs
without taking in mood as a factor. A user may like party
songs as well as soothing songs, but recommending a song
in any one of these categories requires not just the history of
the songs the user like but also capturing the current mood
of the user. If a person is in the mood to listen to a party
song, he wouldnâ€™t want the app to recommend a slow song,
which statistically, according to his history is apt but just not
suitable for the current mood.

So, we can solve this problem by asking one particular
question; given a song the user is currently listening to, which
song will the user like to listen to next?
This is the question we are trying to answer in this project.
We are trying to find similarity in the song being played by
the user with the list of songs available in our dataset by
using clustering techniques. After generating a playlist of
songs similar to the current song, we use popularity based
recommendation system to recommend the next song to the
user.

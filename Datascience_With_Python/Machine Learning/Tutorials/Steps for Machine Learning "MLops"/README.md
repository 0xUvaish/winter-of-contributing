## Description:
# **MLOps:**
>MLOps is the amalgam of Machine Learning, DevOps and Data science whose primary goal is to create automated ML pipelines.

# **DevOps:**
>DevOps is a combination of Software Development and Operations and its processes.

## **MLOps Vs DevOps:**

* MLOps aims to manage deployment of machine learning and deep learning models in large-scale production environments.DevOps aims to shorten development cycles, increase deployment velocity and create dependable releases.
* MLOps is much more experimental in nature that is,different features, parameters, models are tried so that the code base and results need to be managed by the data scientists.
* Due to changing data profiles the model has to be refreshed even if it ‘works’ leading to more iterations in the pipeline.
* The summary statistics of data that built the model needs to be monitored so that we can refresh models when needed.

## **MLOps Tools:**

1. **Neptue:** an ML metadata store built for research and production teams running many experiments.
2. **ML Flow:** an open source platform used for managing the whole machine learning lifecycle.
3. **Comet:** helps view and compare all ML experiments in one place.
4. **Metaflow:** created by Netflix this is an open source platform managing large-scale, enterprise-level data science projects.
5. **Kedro:** a python framework used to create reproducible and maintainable code.

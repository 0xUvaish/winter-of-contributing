  <li><b>WHAT IS A LIQUID STATE MACHINE(LSM)?</b><br/><br/>
A Liquid State Machines (LSM) is a computational model which consists basically of intermittent and arbitrary spiking neural networks and multiple neurons.
  An LSM consists of a large collection of units where each unit receives time-varying input 
  from external sources as well as from other nodes. All the nodes are randomly connected to each other.
  The intermittent nature of the connections turns the time-varying input into a Spatio-temporal pattern of activations in the network.

  <li><b>WHAT IS A SPIKING NEURAL NETWORK(SNN)?</b><br/><br/>
Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is a third-generation artificial neuron that's utmost biologically- inspired. 
  They're preferred above the former generations of artificial neurons because the spiking neurons operate in the temporal sphere and 
  their calculation is grounded on time resources. SNNs are getting a dominant agent for brain-inspired neuromorphic 
  computing- emulating the brain with computational tackle. The choice of SNNs is due to their essential effectiveness
  and delicacy on multitudinous cognitive tasks that include speech recognition and image bracket among others.

  <li><b>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIQUID STATE MACHINE(LSM) & ECHO STATE NETWORK(ESM)?</b><br/><br/>
Well, there are not many differences between both of them, b
    oth are recurrent neural networks where the inputs and outputs are trained but recurrent connections are not trained. 
    However, the one key difference among them is that. Echo state networks are a bit more mainstream 
    and generally implemented as artificial recurrent networks with random dynamics, subject to some constraints such as sparsity. 
    Liquid state machines are a bit more niche and are sometimes implemented as spiking networks with more versatile dynamics.

  <li><b>HOW LSM IS IMPORTANT IN MACHINE LEARNING?</b><br/><br/>
<ul>
  <li>LSMs have been put forward as a way to explain the operation of the brain.</li> 
   <li> LSMs proved to be an enhancement over the proposition of artificial neural networks because 
     Circuits aren't hard wired to perform a specific task. </li>
  <li>Simultaneous time inputs are handled naturally. </li>
  <li>Calculations on various time scales can be done using the same network.</li> 
   <li>The same network can perform multiple calculations. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

# Overview of Regression
************************************************************************************
- Regression is a problem of predicting a real-valued label (often called a target) given an unlabeled example. Estimating house price valuation based on house features, such as area,the number of bedrooms, location and so on is a famous example of regression.
- The regression problem is solved by a regression learning algorithm that takes a collection of labeled examples as inputs and produces a model that can take an unlabeled example as input and output a target.

## Advanatges of Regression
The significance of regression analysis lies in the fact that it is all about data: data refers to the statistics and figures that characterise your company. The benefits of regression analysis are that it allows you to essentially crunch the data to assist you make better business decisions now and in the future.

## Applications of Regression
- Prediction
- Forecasting
- Time series modeling
- Determining the casual effect relationship between variables

## Conclusion
Regression is performed when the dependent variable is of continuous data type and Predictors or independent variables could be of any data type like continuous, nominal/categorical etc. Regression method tries to find the best fit line which shows the relationship between the dependent variable and predictors with least error.

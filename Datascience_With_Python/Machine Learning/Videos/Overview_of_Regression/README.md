# What Is Regression?

Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that attempt to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other variables (known as independent variables).

The importance of regression analysis lies in the fact that it provides a powerful statistical method that allows a business to examine the relationship between two or more variables of interest.

# Types of Regression:-

```

> Simple linear regression: Y = a + bX + u
> Multiple linear regression: Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + b3X3 +...+ btXt + u
  Where,
    Y = the variable that you are trying to predict (dependent variable).
    X = the variable that you are using to predict Y (independent variable).
    a = the intercept.
    b = the slope.
    u = the regression residual.

```

# CONCLUSION

Regression is a parametric technique used to predict continuous (dependent) variables given a set of independent variables. It is parametric in nature because it makes certain assumptions (discussed next) based on the data set. If the data set follows those assumptions, regression gives incredible results.

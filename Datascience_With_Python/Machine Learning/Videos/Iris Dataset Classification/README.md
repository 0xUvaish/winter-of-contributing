## INFORMATION ABOUT DATASET

To share my understanding of the concept and techniques I know, I have used Iris dataset which will help to make you understand the concept of different Machine Learning algorithm using different approaches.

* The dataset consist four independent variables and one dependent variable:
1. Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width
2. Label: Species

## DESCRIPTION
The dataset consist of labeled data to develop a model we need to used supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm technique.

## AIM
In this documentation, we understand the concept of machine learning algorithm with the help of an example of iris dataset. 

#### Platform used for dataset: Google Colab
#### Imported Libraries: 
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sklearn



##  DATA EXPLORATION
Before applying ,the first step is data exploration which helps in data analysis. We visualize the data and try to understand it.

### Printing the first five rows of dataset

head() method is used to display first five rows


```
# To display first five rows of the dataset
df.head()

```

### Printing the last five rows of dataset

tail() method is used to display last five rows 
```
# To display last five rows of the dataset
df.tail()
```

### describe()
describe() is used to view some basic statistical details like percentile, mean, std etc. of a data frame or a series of numeric values

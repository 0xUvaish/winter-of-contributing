# Breast Cancer Prediction

# What is Breast Cancer?

Breast cancer could be a disease within which cells within the breast grow out of control. There are different varieties of carcinoma. the type of carcinoma depends on which cells within the breast grow to be cancer. 

Breast cancer can begin in numerous parts of the breast.A breast is formed from three main parts: lobules, ducts, and connective tissue.

# How is the prediction Done
In this study, we predict Breast Cancer by using 6 algorithms:

* Logistic regression classification
* SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification
* Naive bayes classification
* Decision tree classification
* Random forest classification
* K-Nearest Neighbor classification

# Advantages of Breast Cancer Prediction
* Reduces the danger of dying from breast cancer. 
* Reduces the danger of getting to undergo chemotherapy. 
* Allows women to understand the health of their breasts

# Conclusion
From the study, we conclude that the machine learning techniques are able to detect the disease automatically with high accuracy.

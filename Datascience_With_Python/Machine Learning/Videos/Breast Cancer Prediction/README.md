# Introduction

# What is Breast Cancer?
Breast cancer could be a disease within which cells within the breast grow out of control. There are different varieties of carcinoma.<br>The type of carcinoma depends on which cells within the breast grow to be cancer.<br>
Breast cancer can begin in numerous parts of the breast.A breast is formed from three main parts: lobules, ducts, and connective tissue.

# How is the prediction Done?
In this study, we predict Breast Cancer by using 6 algorithms:<br>
1. Logistic regression classification
2. SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification
3. Naive bayes classification
4. Decision tree classification
5. Random forest classification
6. K-Nearest Neighbor classification

# Advantages of Breast Cancer Prediction
* Reduces the danger of dying from breast cancer.
* Reduces the danger of getting to undergo chemotherapy.
* Allows women to understand the health of their breasts

# Conclusion
From the study, we conclude that the machine learning techniques are able to detect the disease automatically with high accuracy.

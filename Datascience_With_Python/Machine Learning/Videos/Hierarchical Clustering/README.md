**Clustering** is a data mining technique which is used to group the data based on their similarities or differences.

*Clustering types:*
- Hierarchical clustering
- Non- Hierarchical clustering

**Hierarchical clustering**

- Hierarchical clustering follows a hierarchy. 
- It can be categorized into two types:*agglomerative clustering and divisive clustering*

**Agglomerative Clustering**
- Bottom-up approach.
- First data points are grouped separately and merged into a single cluster iteratively based on similarity.
- Distance used to measure the similarity between data points.

**Divisive Clustering**
- Top-down approach.
- First data points are grouped into a single cluster and separated into several clusters iteratively based on similarity.
- Distance used to measure the similarity between data points.

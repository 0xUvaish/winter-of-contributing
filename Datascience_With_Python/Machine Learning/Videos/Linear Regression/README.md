## What is a Regression?

In Regression, we plot a graph between the variables which best fit the given data points. 

The machine learning model can deliver predictions regarding the data. In naïve words, “Regression shows a line or curve that passes through all the data points on a target-predictor graph in such a way that the vertical distance between the data points and the regression line is minimum.” 

It is used principally for prediction, forecasting, time series modeling, and determining the causal-effect relationship between variables.

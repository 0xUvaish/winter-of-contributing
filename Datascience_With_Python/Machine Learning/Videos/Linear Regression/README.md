## What is a Regression?

In Regression, we plot a graph between the variables which best fit the given data points. 

The machine learning model can deliver predictions regarding the data. In naïve words, “Regression shows a line or curve that passes through all the data points on a target-predictor graph in such a way that the vertical distance between the data points and the regression line is minimum.” 

It is used principally for prediction, forecasting, time series modeling, and determining the causal-effect relationship between variables.


## Types of Regression models
- Linear 
- Polynomial
- Logistics

## Linear Regression 

- Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning.
-  It performs a regression task. 
- Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. 
- It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. 
- Different regression models differ based on – the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.

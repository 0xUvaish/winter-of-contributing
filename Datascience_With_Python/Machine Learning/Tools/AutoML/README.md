# AUTOMATED MACHINE LEARNING

- Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of applying machine learning (ML) models to real-world problems using automation. More specifically, it automates the selection, composition and parameterization of machine learning models.
- Automated Machine Learning provides methods and processes to make Machine Learning available for non-Machine Learning experts, to improve efficiency of Machine Learning and to accelerate research on Machine Learning. 
- Automating the machine learning process makes it more user-friendly and often provides faster, more accurate outputs than hand-coded algorithms.
- AutoML software platforms make machine learning more user-friendly and give organizations without a specialized data scientist or machine learning expert access to machine learning.

# AutoML Process

<p>AutoML is typically a platform or open source library that simplifies each step in the machine learning process, from handling a raw dataset to deploying a practical machine learning model. <br><br>
In traditional machine learning, models are developed by hand, and each step in the process must be handled separately.</p><br>

<p>Hhere are some of the steps of the machine learning process that AutoML can automate, in the order they occur in the process:</p>

- Raw data processing
- Feature engineering and feature selection
- Model selection
- Hyperparameter optimization and parameter optimization
- Deployment with consideration for business and technology constraints
- Evaluation metric selection
- Monitoring and problem checking
- Analysis of results

# Pros and Cons of AutoML

## Pros :

<p>The main benefits of AutoML are:</p>

- <b>Efficiency</b> : It speeds up and simplifies the machine learning process and reduces training time of machine learning models.
- <b>Cost savings</b> : Having a faster, more efficient machine learning process means a company can save money by devoting less of its budget to maintaining that process.
- <b>Accessibility</b> : Having a simpler process allows companies to save money on training staff or hiring experts. It also makes machine learning a viable possibility for a wider range of companies.
- <b>Performance</b> : AutoML algorithms also tend to be more efficient than hand-coded models.

## Cons :

- The main challenge of AutoML is the temptation to view it as a replacement for human knowledge. Like most automation, AutoML is designed to perform rote tasks efficiently with accuracy and precision, freeing up employees to focus on more complex or novel tasks. Things that AutoML automates, like monitoring, analysis and problem detection, are rote tasks that are faster if automated. A human should still be involved to assess and supervise the model, but no longer needs to participate in the machine learning process step-by-step. AutoML should help improve data scientist and employee efficiency, not replace them.

- Another challenge is that AutoML is a relatively new field and some of the most popular tools are not yet fully developed.

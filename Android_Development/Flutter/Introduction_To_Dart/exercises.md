## Strings

A Dart string is a sequence of UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation Format) code units. It makes Dart more powerful to build our mobile and web applications in any language. In this tutorial, we’re gonna look at many Dart String Functions & Operators that are helpful. You will know:

How to create Strings in Dart ?
How to input data from a String in Dart ?
How to get a substring from a given String in Dart ?

### How to create Strings in Dart ?

In JavaScript and other programming languages the key word _if_ is to used check if a condition is true and to execute the block code. To create an if condition, we need _if_ keyword, condition inside a parenthesis and block of code inside a curly bracket({}).

```dart
// syntax
if (condition) {
  //this part of code runs for truthy condition
}
```

**Example:**

```dart
let num = 3
if (num > 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is a positive number`)
}
//  3 is a positive number
```

As you can see in the  condition example above, 3 is greater than 0, so it is a positive number. The condition was true and the block of code was executed. However, if the condition is false, we won't  see any results.

```dart
let isRaining = true
if (isRaining) {
  console.log('Remember to take your rain coat.')
}
```

 The same goes for the second condition, if isRaining is false the if block will not be executed and we do not see any output. In order to see the result of a falsy condition, we should have another block, which is going to be _else_.

### How to input data from a String in Dart ?

If condition is true the first block will be executed, if not the else condition will be executed.

```js
// syntax
if (condition) {
  // this part of code runs for truthy condition
} else {
  // this part of code runs for false condition
}
```

```js
let num = 3
if (num > 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is a positive number`)
} else {
  console.log(`${num} is a negative number`)
}
//  3 is a positive number

num = -3
if (num > 0) {
  console.log(`${num} is a positive number`)
} else {
  console.log(`${num} is a negative number`)
}
//  -3 is a negative number
```

```js
let isRaining = true
if (isRaining) {
  console.log('You need a rain coat.')
} else {
  console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
}
// You need a rain coat.

isRaining = false
if (isRaining) {
  console.log('You need a rain coat.')
} else {
  console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
}
// No need for a rain coat.
```

The last condition is false, therefore the else block was executed. What if we have more than two conditions? In that case,  we would use *else if* conditions.

### How to get a substring from a given String in Dart ?

On our daily life, we make decisions on daily basis. We make decisions not by checking  one or two conditions instead we make decisions based on multiple conditions. As similar to our daily life, programming is also full of conditions. We use *else if* when we have multiple conditions.

```js
// syntax
if (condition) {
     // code
} else if (condition) {
   // code
} else {
    //  code

}
```

**Example:**

```js
let a = 0
if (a > 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is a positive number`)
} else if (a < 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is a negative number`)
} else if (a == 0) {
  console.log(`${a} is zero`)
} else {
  console.log(`${a} is not a number`)
}
```

```js
// if else if else
let weather = 'sunny'
if (weather === 'rainy') {
  console.log('You need a rain coat.')
} else if (weather === 'cloudy') {
  console.log('It might be cold, you need a jacket.')
} else if (weather === 'sunny') {
  console.log('Go out freely.')
} else {
  console.log('No need for rain coat.')
}
```


## 💻 Exercises

### Exercises: Level 1

1. Get user input using prompt(“Enter your age:”). If user is 18 or older , give feedback:'You are old enough to drive' but if not 18 give another feedback stating to  wait for the number of years he neds to turn 18.

   ```sh
   Enter your age: 30
   You are old enough to drive.

   Enter your age:15
   You are left with 3 years to drive.
   ```

1. Compare the values of myAge and yourAge using if … else. Based on the comparison and log the result to console stating who is older (me or you). Use prompt(“Enter your age:”) to get the age as input.

   ```sh
   Enter your age: 30
   You are 5 years older than me.
   ```

1. If a is greater than b return 'a is greater than b' else 'a is less than b'. Try to implement it in to ways

    - using if else
    - ternary operator.

    ```js
      let a = 4
      let b = 3
    ```

    ```sh
      4 is greater than 3
    ```

1. Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check, if a number is even or not using JavaScript?

    ```sh
    Enter a number: 2
    2 is an even number

    Enter a number: 9
    9 is is an odd number.
    ```

### Exercises: Level 2

1. Write a code which  can give grades to students according to theirs scores:
   - 80-100, A
   - 70-89, B
   - 60-69, C
   - 50-59, D
   - 0-49, F
1. Check if the season is Autumn, Winter, Spring or Summer.
   If the user input is :
   - September, October or November, the season is Autumn.
   - December, January or February, the season is Winter.
   - March, April or May, the season is Spring
   - June, July or August, the season is Summer
1. Check if a day is weekend day or a working day. Your script will take day as an input.

```sh
    What is the day  today? Saturday
    Saturday is a weekend.

    What is the day today? saturDaY
    Saturday is a weekend.

    What is the day today? Friday
    Friday is a working day.

    What is the day today? FrIDAy
    Friday is a working day.
  ```

### Exercises: Level 3

1. Write a program which tells the number of days in a month.

  ```sh
    Enter a month: January
    January has 31 days.

    Enter a month: JANUARY
    January has 31 day

    Enter a month: February
    February has 28 days.

    Enter a month: FEbruary
    February has 28 days.
  ```

1. Write a program which tells the number of days in a month, now consider leap year.

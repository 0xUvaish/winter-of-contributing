The data mining approach includes multi-dimensional databases, statistics, Machine Learning, data visualization, and soft computing that can have massive applications in the industry. It can help predict the volume of patients in every category, improve processes to ensure that patients receive appropriate care without delays or setbacks, detect fraud and abuse for insurance purposes, and many more.\n",

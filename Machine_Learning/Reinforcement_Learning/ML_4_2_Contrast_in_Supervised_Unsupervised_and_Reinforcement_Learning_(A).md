## **Short Overview**

>### **Supervised Learning**

Supervised learning, as the name indicates, has the presence of a supervisor as a teacher. Basically supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine using data that is well labeled. Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. After that, the machine is provided with a new set of examples(data) so that the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labeled data. 

>### **Unsupervised Learning**

Unsupervised learning studies how systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. The system doesn’t predict the right output, but instead, it explores the data and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.

>### **Reinforcement Learning**

This family of models consists of algorithms that use the estimated errors as rewards or penalties. If the error is big, then the penalty is high and the reward low. If the error is small, then the penalty is low and the reward high.

Trial error search and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning. This family of models allows the automatic determination of the ideal behavior within a specific context in order to maximize the desired performance.
Reward feedback is required for the model to learn which action is best and this is known as “the reinforcement signal”.

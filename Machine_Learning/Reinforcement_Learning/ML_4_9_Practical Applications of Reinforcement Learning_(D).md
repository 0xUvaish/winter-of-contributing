# **Practical Applications of Reinforcement Learning**

Before discussing about some of the great real-life applications or use cases of Rienforcement Learning. Lets have some brief about the Reinforcement Learning itslef.

## **Reinforcement Learning**
<br />

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error.  

In reinforcement learning (RL), an agent is trained to achieve a goal based on the feedback it receives as it interacts with an environment. It collects a number as a reward for each action it takes. Actions that help the agent achieve its goal are incentivized with higher numbers. Unhelpful actions result in a low reward or no reward.

With a learning objective of maximizing total cumulative reward, over time, the agent learns, through trial and error, to map gainful actions to situations. The better trained the agent, the more efficiently it chooses actions that accomplish its goal.

## **Practical Applications**
<br>
Today Reinforcement Learning is used in variety of fields to solve real-world problems. Lets take a look at couple of examples.
<br ><br> 

1. **Great at playing games**

    * The AlphaGo Zero software used reinforcement Leanring to defeat the human master in the complex board game Go.
    * AplhaStar software used reinforcement learning  to reach *grandmaster* status in real-time strategy game **StarCraft II**.

2. **Wind Energy Optimization**

    * When multiple turbines work together in a wind farm, the turbines in the front, which receive the wind first, can cause poor wind conditions for the turbines behind them. This is called **wake turbulence** and it reduces the amount of energy that is captured and converted into electrical power
    * Wind energy organizations around the world use reinforcement learning to test solutions. Their models respond to changing wind conditions by changing the angle of the turbine blades. When the upstream turbines slow down it helps the downstream turbines capture more energy.

3. **Self-Driving Cars**

    * In self-driving cars, there are various aspects to consider, such as speed limits at various places, drivable zones, avoiding collisions.
    * Some of the autonomous driving tasks where reinforcement learning could be applied include trajectory optimization, motion planning, dynamic pathing, controller optimization, and scenario-based learning policies for highways.
    * AWS DeepRacer is an autonomous racing car that has been designed to test out RL in a physical track. It uses cameras to visualize the runway and a reinforcement learning model to control the throttle and direction.
    * And of the best example for this would be **Tesla** they are using reinforcement learning along with computer vision to train their their car models.

4. **Industrial Automation**

    * Microsoft recently announced Project Bonsai a machine learning platform for autonomous industrial control systems. They call it machine teaching where autonomous industrial machines can be trained using reinforcement learning in their simulation environment to make them intelligent enough to carry out operations. For example, the autonomous forklift can be trained to align itself with a pallet, lift the pallet, put it down, all with the help of their reinforcement learning platform.

5. **Stock Trading**

    * Stock Market Trading has been one of the hottest areas where reinforcement learning can be put to good use. Algorithmic trading is an old field where stocks are traded with the help of algorithms to achieve better returns and reinforcement learning based financial systems can optimize the returns from stocks further.

6. **Online Recommendation**

    * Reinforcement Learning is being considered a useful tool for improving online recommendations. Reinforcement learning can take into account factors of both seller and buyer for training purposes and the results have been beyond expectations.

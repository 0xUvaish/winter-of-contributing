<h3> What is Machine learning?</h3>
<p>Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.</p>
<h3>Types of Machine Learning: </h3>

<h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
<p>Supervised Learning is a  of type of learning where the input is mapped to the output. It uses labelled dataset to acuurately predict the output.  Some examples of this method is Linear Regression,Random forest.</p>
<h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
<p>Unsupervised Learning is a of type of learning where there is no labelled output. These algorithms identify pattern in the dataset and then classiy the output based on the pattern. In simple words Unsupervised learning allows the system to identify patterns on its own.Some examples of this method is Linear Regression,Support Vector Machines.</p>
<h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
<p>Reinforcement Learning is a kind of type of learning that is based on reward mechanism. It rewards the desired outcome and punishes the undesired one.The goal is to maximize the reward.</p>
<br />
<b> We can say that Supervised Learning is to generate formulae based on input and output. Unsupervised Learning is to find association between input and output. Reinforcement Learning is to learn though agent  delayed feedback by interacting with the environment.</b>

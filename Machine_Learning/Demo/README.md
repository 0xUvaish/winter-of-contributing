This folder contains the demo file namings of all the three categories. It's only for the demo purpose, nothing else.

**Documentation**

File name : `ML_<serial number>_<name of the issue>_(type of contribution).md` or `.ipynb`

Example : `ML_1_2_PDFs and CDFs_(D).md`

**_Both markdown file and ipynb file are accepted!_**

*************************************

**Audio and Video**
In both cases we need a thumbnail, which will be hyperlinked with the Google drive link you have.

File name : `ML_<serial number>_<name of the issue>_(A/V).md` [A for Audio and V for Video]

Example Audio file name : `ML_1_2_PDFs and CDFs_(A).md`

Example Video file name : `ML_1_2_PDFs and CDFs_(V).md`

Inside the markdown file you have to attach the thumbnail and then hyperlink the thumbnail with the link of your file. For the thumbnail, upload the image in the `Assets` folder, and take the URL of the image from their to add the thumbnail in the markdown file.

<h1>Neural Networks</h1>
A Neural network is also known as Artifical Neural Network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way bological neurons signal to each other. It is the  In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature. These are the heart of the deep learning.

<h1> Feed Forward Neural Network</h1>
Feed Forward Neural Network is a classification algorithim.It is an artifical neural network in which the nodes doesnt form any cycle or directed acyyclic graph..It is the simplest form of neural network. It opposite is reccurent neural network in which the nodes form a cycle .<br>
It forms a single layer perceptron. Structure of a feed forward is an advantage for certain applications.Examples of feed forward neural network is radial basis function networks, which uses activation function.

<h2>How does a Feed Forward Network work? </h2>
 It is basically a single layer perceptron. In this model series of input enters the layer and then multipied with its weights. All the values are added to get the sum of weighted inputs and checks if the value is above a specif threshold. If it is then it is set to zero and if less than threshold then it is set to -1.  This model is mostly used in classification tasks.This process of training and learning produces a form of a gradient descent.<br>
  Using a property known as the delta rule, the neural network can compare the outputs of its nodes with the intended values, thus allowing the network to adjust its weights through training in order to produce more accurate output values.

More generally, any directed acyclic graph may be used for a feedforward network, with some nodes (with no parents) designated as inputs, and some nodes (with no children) designated as outputs.

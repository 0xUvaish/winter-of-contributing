Image Classification helps us to classify what is contained in an image. Image Localization will specify the location of single object in an image whereas Object Detection specifies the location of multiple objects in the image. Finally, Image Segmentation will create a pixel wise mask of each object in the images.

<h3>What is Image Segementation?</h3>
Image segmentation is a method in which a digital image is broken down into various subgroups called Image segments which helps in reducing the complexity of the image to make further processing or analysis of the image simpler

<b>Object Detection</b> is the capability of software systems to locate objects in an image/scene and identify each object. Object Classification has been widely used for face Classification, vehicle Classification, pedestrian counting, web images, security systems and driverless cars.

In simple words object Detection helps us to identify the location of a single object in the given image.
The goal of this Classification technique is to determine where objects are located in a given image called as object localisation and which category each object belongs to, that is called as object classification.

<h3>Difference between Object detection and Object Localisation</h3>
<b>Object detection</b> refers to the overall task, usually assuming the object is also classified after it is detected.<br>
<b>Object Localization</b> refers to the coordinates of the object.<br>

<h3>Difference between Object detection and Object Classification</h3>
<b>Object Classification</b> -You are given an image, classify this image to some class like Apple, bus, forest etc.
<b>Object detection</b> - You are given an image, find out if there exist a patch(or coordinates) where the class exists? eg - Given an image predict whether classes(like oranges, truck, lion) exist in image or not.
<h3>Some Algorithms for Objection Detection</h3>

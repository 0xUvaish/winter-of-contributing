Contribution Approaches-P Value is also called Probabilistic Valuue. This is a numerical value that will describe how likely it is that our data would have occured by any random
chance. This has high correspondence with the theory of Hypothesis Testing which has 2 most important concepts called Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis. P value always has
a value range of 0 and 1. Smaller p value denotes that we should strongly reject Null Hypothesis and accept the Alternative Hypothesis. We can also denote p value on graph plotted
shows the likeliness of occurance. The peak of the graph and the lower part of the graph denotes the occurance.

#+TITLE: Data Types And Compound Types

* DATA TYPES :
 + Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data

* SCALAR TYPES :
 + A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

** Integer Types :
+ An integer is a number without a fractional component.
  | Length  | Signed | Unsigned |
  |---------+--------+----------|
  | 8-bit   | i8     | u8       |
  | 16-bit  | i16    | u16      |
  | 32-bit  | i32    | u32      |
  | 64-bit  | i64    | u64      |
  | 128-bit | i128   | u128     |
  | arch    | isize  | usize    |
+ Signed numbers are stored using Two's complement representation .
+ isize and usize are depends on the architecture of the computer on which the program is running on .

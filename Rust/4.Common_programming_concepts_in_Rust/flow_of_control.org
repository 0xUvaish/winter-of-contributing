#+TITLE: Flow of Control

#+begin_quote
Deciding whether or not to run some code depending on if a condition is true and deciding to run some code repeatedly while a condition is true are basic building blocks in most programming languages
#+end_quote
* if Expressions
+ An if expression allows you to branch your code depending on conditions. You provide a condition and then state, “If this condition is met, run this block of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code.”
 #+begin_src rust
 fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
 #+end_src

** Using if in a let Statement
+ Because if is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a let statement
#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
#+end_src

* Else if Expressions
+ You can have multiple conditions by combining if and else in an else if expression.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
#+end_src

* Iteration with LOOPS

** loop
 + The loop keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.
#+begin_src rust

fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {}", count);
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {}", remaining);
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up; // break loop with the label i.e. th e outer loop
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {}", count);
}

#+end_src

 * *Returning values from LOOPS* can done by /adding the *value*/ to be *returned after the /break/ keyword* .
  #+begin_src rust

   fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {}", result);// prints 20 as 10*2
}

  #+end_src
** Conditional Loops with while
 + It’s often useful for a program to evaluate a condition within a loop. While the condition is true, the loop runs.

# Let's Setup a New Project in Rust : 
- Setting up a project in Rust in relatively is simple , all one needs is **cargo**
- Let's first navigate to the directory where you want to keep your project ðŸŒ¿

> Weâ€™ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Hereâ€™s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.

```bash
cargo new guessing_game
cd guessing_game
```

- This create a code template for you to start with .
- **The cargo.toml** file is important and we will writing the code in the **src/main.rs** rust file

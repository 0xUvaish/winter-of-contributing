#+TITLE: References and Borrowing
+ As Rust Ownership rules say one owner at a time but there might some cases where we need to perform an action on data without affecting its original value. *This is done via borrowing*.
+ *Borrowing is like in general when we borrow something, and we are done with it, we give it back, but this doesnâ€™t make us the owner of the data.*
+ *Reference is an address that is passed to a function as an argument, and they always start with ampersand(&).*
#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}

#+end_src
+ /These ampersands are references, and they allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it/.

+ If we trying to *modify the data that we have borrowed then it will result in an error*.

+ *References by default are immutable just like variables*.

** Mutable ReferencesðŸ’±:
+ This can be done by adding the =mut= keyword in front of the variable name .
 #+begin_src rust

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", GWOC!!!");
}

 #+end_src
  * *But mutable references have one big restriction: you can have only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data at a time*.
    - This won't work :

    #+begin_src rust

     let mut s = String::from("hello");

     let r1 = &mut s; // here we take the mutable borrow
     let r2 = &mut s; // this fails as we already have a borrow held by r1â€¼

     println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);

    #+end_src

  * The restriction preventing multiple mutable references to the same data at the same time allows for mutation but in a very controlled fashion
*** HOW THIS ALL PREVENTS DATA RACE:
+ A data race is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:
  1. Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
  2. At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
  3. Thereâ€™s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

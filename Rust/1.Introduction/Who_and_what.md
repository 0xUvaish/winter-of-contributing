# What is Rust Exactly ?  ðŸ¦€ 
<br/>

+ ### As Defined by the Rust Book :  
>The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.

 #### **Rust** is a wonderful language , it enables you to develop and test your code very efficiently .

- Most of us have dwelled in web development to some extent that is , but very few of us are able to code out  well tuned C/C++ code , well the reason is quiet obvious as C/C++ expect you to be memory management wizard , and I don't know about you but I certainly am not .

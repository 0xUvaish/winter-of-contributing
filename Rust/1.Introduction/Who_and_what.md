# What is Rust Exactly ?  ðŸ¦€ 
<br/>

+ ### As Defined by the Rust Book :  
>The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.

 #### **Rust** is a wonderful language , it enables you to develop and test your code very efficiently .

- Most of us have dwelled in web development to some extent that is , but very few of us are able to code out  well tuned C/C++ code , well the reason is quiet obvious as **C/C++ expect you to be memory management wizard** , and I don't know about you but I certainly am not . 

- **Rust is your saviour here** , the language is built with keeping these problems at the helm , so you can get to creating performant code , as fast as C/C++ without the hassle of taking care of everything that is going on .

-  Awesome tooling and package management with **crates and cargo**

## Hello Ocean :

```Rust
// This is a comment, and is ignored by the compiler
// You can test this code by clicking the "Run" button over there ->
// or if you prefer to use your keyboard, you can use the "Ctrl + Enter" shortcut

// This code is editable, feel free to hack it!
// You can always return to the original code by clicking the "Reset" button ->

// This is the main function
fn main() {
    // Statements here are executed when the compiled binary is called

    // Print text to the console
    println!("Hello Ocean!ðŸ¦€ ");
}

```

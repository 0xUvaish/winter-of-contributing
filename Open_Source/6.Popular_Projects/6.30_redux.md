## Introduction

Redux is a *predictable state container* designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across *client*, *server*, and *native environments* and are easy to test.

While it's mostly used as a state management tool with ReactJs, you can use it with any other JavaScript framework or library like [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and... . It's lightweight at *2KB* (including dependencies), so you don't have to worry about it making your application's asset size bigger.

With Redux, the state of your application is kept in a store, and each component can access any state that it needs from this store.

## Why should we use Redux(what problem does Redux solve)?

What to learn can be an overwhelming question for a JavaScript developer. It helps to narrow the range of options by learning one thing at a time and focusing on problems you find in your work. Redux is a pattern for managing application state. If you do not have problems with state management, you might find the benefits of Redux harder to understand. Some UI libraries (like React) have their own state management system. If you are using one of these libraries, especially if you are just learning to use them, we encourage you to learn the capabilities of that built-in system first. It might be all you need to build your application. If your application becomes so complex that you are confused about where state is stored or how state changes, then it is a good time for Redux to come to the scene.

### 1. Redux makes the state predictable

In Redux, the state is always predictable. If the same state and action are passed to a reducer, the same result is always produced because reducers are pure functions(if you don't know about pure function, I recommend you to read [this article](https://medium.com/technofunnel/working-with-react-pure-components-166ded26ae48)). The state is also immutable(never changed). This makes it possible to implement arduous tasks like infinite undo and redo.

### 2. easy Debugging with Redux

Redux makes it easy to debug an application. By logging actions and state, it is easy to understand coding errors, network errors, and other forms of bugs that might come up during production.\
For medium and large-scale apps, debugging takes more time then actually developing features. Redux DevTools makes it easy to take advantage of all Redux has to offer.

### 3. Ease of testing

It is easy to test Redux apps since functions used to change the state of pure functions.

### 4. Server-side rendering

Redux can also be used for server-side rendering. With it, you can handle the initial render of the app by sending the state of an app to the server along with its response to the server request. The required components are then rendered in HTML and sent to the users.

### 5. Community and ecosystem

This is a huge plus whenever you're learning or using any library or framework. Having a community behind Redux makes it even more appealing to use.

Let’s hear the conversation between Priya who is a 6 yr old kid and a computer technician who is helping her resolve her computer issues, so that she can start studying again without any extra delay

(Conversation...)

***Priya***: Technician my computer is gone mad, it randomly opens and shuts the application and starts behaving randomly at random instance of time.

***Technician***:Woah Woah Woah, Wait up kid. Let me check
(Technician does multiple checks over the software/main drive of the systems, pulls out some basic attacks to find out the vulnerability)

***Technician***: Ma’am your computer is infected with a virus?

***Priya***: What a joke, how can a computer catch corona, you are worthless.

***Technician***: No this is not corona, this is a technical virus

***Priya***: A technical virus, what is that?

***Technician***: Let’s understand this from the [GWOC’s Cybersecurity blog](https://github.com/PrachiDoshi2170/winter-of-contributing/tree/main/Cyber_Security)

## What is a virus?

A virus is a malicious code that attaches itself to the target portion of the computer after getting downloaded with a software, surfing through insecure websites, viewing virus infected advertisements, attaching infected USB or opening an email attachment. After the virus attaches itself to the host computer it is dormant until human intervention occurs. 

When a human clicks on a particular host program that has a virus attached to it, it turns active and  replicates itself making multiple copies and then attaches itself to a lot of other computer resources/softwares thereby infecting the computer’s boot process or infecting the user's sensitive documents. Therefore a virus always requires someone knowingly or unknowingly to spread the infection. 

(Conversation...)

***Priya*** : Ook so even computers are infected by a virus similarly as humans,but then as humans have WBC's, don’t computers have some counter attack mechanisms?

***Technician***: Nice question, let’s dive in more to find out about it?

Though computers have antivirus and antimalware softwares installed in the system to secure the software from any harm, many viruses include evasion or obfuscation capabilities designed to bypass these antivirus or antimalware softwares and various other security defenses. The advancement in polymorphic malware development had made virus identification and eradication a difficult task.

(Conversartion...)

***Priya***: Polymorphic Malware development

***Technician***: Yes, the kind of malware that can dynamically adapt and change according to the environment and thus creating a vaccination(antivirus) for it becomes difficult, because the identification becomes difficult and without identification it is hard to come up with a cure.

***Priya***: Ohhh ! So what kind of virus is my computer infected with?

***Technician***: Little Human, Your computer is as unique as you are. You computer is infected with an Overwrite Virus

***Priya***: What is an overwrite virus :confused:

## What is an overwrite virus
---
A computer overwrite virus is a form of self-replicating malware that deletes data as it spreads.The main objective of the overwrite virus is to delete all the data from the system that is infected with it.

#### Popular types of Overwrite Virus
* [Grog.202/456](https://www.spamlaws.com/overwriting-virus.html)
Grog.202/456 typically targets your .COM files, deletes them, and overwrites them with harmful code. In case there is no .Com file the virus can even target the internet-connected network devices by calling over the users modem. 

* [Grog.377](https://www.virusradar.com/en/Grog.377/description)
This one targets a specific area of your hard disk looking out for special instructions. If the virus detects and finds the instruction it overwrites it with malicious code. This can cause considerable damage to your device including BIOS and several device booting issues. 

* [LoveLetter](https://www.virusradar.com/en/Grog.377/description)
This is one of the deadliest forms of the Overwrite virus. Its ability to act as a Trojan, file infectors and email worm makes it different from its other family members. 

The only way you can combat data loss due to the Overwrite virus is through data backups as there is no other way in which you can disinfect your original files. 

## Diagnosis : How does it affect
---
After infecting the system, an overwrite virus begin’s overwriting the source code of the original file/application with its own code. It installs new code in files and applications that programs them to spread the virus to additional files, applications and systems. Thus an overwriting virus can destroy your files,delete your sensitive data,override your application, causing them to malfunction or crash at launch or affecting the booting process of the whole system.

(Conversation...)

***Priya***: Oh no my drawings, my video recording and my achievements, are all going to be deleted now, please can you help me restore them or save them?

***Technician***: Well I have encountered this virus for the first time, so let’s continue reading the blog to find

***Priya***: Oh god please help me.:scream:

## Symptoms : Whether the computer is  infected with an overwrite virus or not?
---
* Since the overwrite virus replicates the original source code in the application, the application gets corrupted from base thereby destroying the application as whole.
* If the virus spreads to the documented files there are heavy chances of sensitive data loss.
* If the virus gets attached to the OS boot file than the booting time of the computer grows exponentially until the issue is resolved.
* Since the overwrite virus replaces the source code, the recovery of the original file is from the hard drive after deletion is impossible, hence the damage or loss is permanent.

(Conversation...)

***Priya***: So this means if my files are infected by virus they are lost.

***Technician***: That is true if the virus is attached to your files, then they are lost permanently. Now why did this happen because you had no knowledge of how to prevent this or avoid this.

***Priya***: Oh no :sob:

***Technician***: Don’t worry, let us first check which files can be recovered and then let us learn how can we prevent this in the future.

***Priya***: Okay :cry:

(Technician takes the backup of the unaffected files and resets the computer to its base setting and imports the backup again. Though there was some data loss and unluckily priya did lose some of her favourite drawings but now if you don’t want to make the same mistake again, go on read the remaining set)

***Technician***: I know some of your data is lost,but now we are going to ensure that this virus never infects your computer again. So what are we going to do now?

***Priya***: We are going to learn how to protect and prevent our computer from getting infected. Basically we are going to get the vaccination for my computer

***Technician***: Perfect.

## Vaccination : Protection against Computer Overwrite Virus
---
* Install a high quality antivirus program
* Avoid web surfing on insecure websites, clicking on insecure add-pop ups, opening weirdly redirected websites and payment through insecure channels.
* Ensure that the websites that you are surfing are SSL protected
* Avoid clicking on links or attachments that come along with a spam email
* Periodic scanning and patching of applications and software to avoid the end moment crisis.
* Take periodic backups of important files and documents over cloud or hardrive

(Conversation....)

***Technician***: So now what are we going to do?

***Priya***: I am going to install the antivirus and do periodic scanning and not surf through insecure websites and keep my computer secure. 

***Technician***: Excellent

## Conclusion
---
Thus it is extremely important to have basic knowledge about different types of virus and their solutions. Overwrite virus was last seen to be implemented in MS-DOS and since then there have been very less attacks, but it is mandatory to invest in the antivirus software for safe surfing and avoiding data loss. This periodic scanning of the software adds to the betterment of performance of computer every time, analogous to how humans behave after their recovery. Thus keep your computer and data safe.

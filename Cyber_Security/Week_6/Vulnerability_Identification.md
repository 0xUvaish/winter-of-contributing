<h1 align="center">What is Cybersecurity Vulnerability?
</h1><br>

A cybersecurity vulnerability is any weakness within an organization’s information systems, internal controls, or 
system processes that can be exploited by cybercriminals.
Through points of vulnerability, cyber adversaries are able to gain access to our system and collect data.
With regard to our organization’s overall security posture, cybersecurity vulnerabilities are extremely important 
to monitor as gaps in a network can lead to a full-scale breach of a system.


## Identify vulnerabilities

Vulnerability identification is the process of locating and noting exploitable gaps in your network operations.
This is typically done through the use of vulnerability scanners which periodically assess network systems for misconfigurations,
incorrect file system structures, and more. The results of the scans are then cross-referenced with known security intelligence databases.
In order to get accurate results, it is critical that the scanner is properly configured and up-to-date.
It is recommended that you administer a test-run during off-hours so that you can evaluate the accuracy of results and make adjustments where necessary.

## How to identify Security Vulnerabilities?

<b>1. Watch your own network:</b><br>
The most important way to identify threats and vulnerabilities is to make sure we can see them. We have to look at our defenses the way an attacker would and understanding the weaknesses in our network & threats most likely to affect our organization.<br>

<b>2. Use threat intelligence:</b><br>
What sort of attacks are being launched and which threats our organization might attract to? By understanding the threat landscape, we can protect our organization against threats before they happen.<br>

<b>3. Penetration testing:</b><br>
Where do our defenses buckle under pressure? Which employee is likely to click a bad link in a suspicious email? We can’t know until we test our defenses. Penetration testing is the best way resolve this issue.<br>

<b>4. Manage permissions:</b><br>
By segmenting our network and managing permissions so that not every employee can access every part of your network, we can control who sees what — and also protect our network against data breaches and malicious insiders.<br>

<b>5. Use a firewall:</b><br>
There’s no reason not to use firewalls, internally and externally. Firewalls keep unauthorized users from getting access to our network. They also keep tabs on the traffic throughout our network.<br>

<b>6. Constantly monitor our network:</b><br>
Security needs to be constantly monitored to be effective. Once we’ve set our controls, make sure they’re checked regularly and updated often so that we can catch any new vulnerabilities or threats that may target our network.<br>

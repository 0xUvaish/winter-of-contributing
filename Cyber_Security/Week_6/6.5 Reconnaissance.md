 Well, if the condition is put in front of you to rule a country for a day and suddenly there is war looming on your reign, what will be your first step of strategy against your enemy?

It is simple, when you receive the news of war,  you will definitely call for your chief of commander and advisor to brief you about the intensity of the threat(target), what kind of resources and alliances they possess, where are they going to strike us and will we be able to defend ourselves on that ground, and when it comes down to capturing or negotiation what will be our strategy. In brief, we gather the data about our opponent or letâ€™s say the target.

Analogous to this, when a computer hacker plans to stage an attack on the target framework/application, the hacker tries to covertly discover and collect data regarding their firewalls, OS used, network map, number of servers and users attached to the framework etc. 

**This data collection can be used to stage a successful attack or penetrate the framework to expose the security vulnerability of the organisation ethically. This process of gaining the information by collecting the data before staging the attack is called [Reconnaissance](https://www.blumira.com/glossary/reconnaissance/#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20cybersecurity,collecting%20information%20about%20a%20system.&text=Like%20many%20cybersecurity%20terms%2C%20reconnaissance,obtaining%20information%20from%20enemy%20territory.)**.


# The Golden Snitch
---
Now generally people think that hackers will attack the server and thus gain access to all the connected computer systems in return giving them access to all the information stored or shared with those systems.

But in reality it is not true. The goal of recon is not gaining access to the system primarily, rather it is gathering knowledge about the weak patches of the target system. This could help the hacker in building the right strategy as they are well aware of the defensive and the offensive capabilities of the target system.

ðŸ¤” The question that still dangle in the air is how exactly the recon occurs, what kind of tools are used and what are the methods that are used to detect the recon, and how is the information obtained equivalent to the golden snitch?

### How recon takes place
___
There are two types of methods to conduct reconnaissance:

**1. Active Reconnaissance**: Gathering information of the target system by entering the network area directly and then staging an attack to find the loopholes is called active recon.

* One of the methods is pinging all the IP addresses in the network.
* More sophisticated scans attempt a TCP connection with every port number of a specific IP address to determine which ports are open and, therefore, which services are running on the host at that IP address.
* Multiple tools are used for network scanning, pinging, tracing the routers connected over a network that can be hacked easily in the future penetration.

**2. Passive Reconnaissance:** Gathering information of the target system without insinuating suspicion of surveillance is called passive recon.

* Now the main trick is not to visit the targetâ€™s network frequently to avoid storing your IP address in the administrator log of the network that might send an alert to the administrator and could add to the chances of revealing your hack.
* To achieve this, it is more advisable to gather the information of the target network or system via information available freely on the Internet and targeting the information available freely on the targetâ€™s website. 
* View their source html codes, some information regarding their social media accounts which could give hints as to what their user account password is. Names can be entered in a white pages search to reveal home addresses and telephone numbers, which can expand footprinting to an employee's home.
* Network information can also be obtained freely via public records online. Every IP address and Domain Name must be registered in a public database. As a result, a few queries to the right places will provide anyone with the target domain's IP address range, DNS servers, and a contact address and telephone number.

### Famous Tools used during Recon and their uses
___
**1. [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/):** It is an opensource tool that helps you to gather legitimate data from the free resources available. It provides a simple web-based interface that allows us to browse different OSINT tools filtered by categories. It also provides an excellent classification of all existing intel sources, making it a great resource for knowing what Information areas are we neglecting to explore, or what will be the next suggested OSINT steps for our investigation.

**2. [NMAP](https://nmap.org/):** It is an open-source network utility tools that helps you to detect the network discovery, security auditing,network inventory,managing service and host uptime etc.

**3. [Nikto](https://cirt.net/Nikto2):** Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers. It also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will attempt to identify installed web server and softwares.

**4. [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/):** Wireshark is the worldâ€™s foremost tools for network analysis, network troubleshooting, scans developed security protocols and it majorly used for the passive recon, 
netcat:netcat is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP.

and many moreâ€¦â€¦â€¦.. The tools might be different for passive and active recon, but right from finding ports, network map to OS information these tools are capable of turning a computer against itself, as it scans through the deepest section of the network or information available.

### What information do we receive from recon ?
---
During the recon the hacker tries to gather the information regarding various aspects of the communication protocol like :
* Gathering initial information
* Determine the network range
* Identify active machines
* Discover open ports and access points
* Fingerprint the operating system
* Uncover services on ports
* Map the network

All these data gathering is carried out using the set of open source and licensed tools available for the better understanding of the vulnerabilities of the application of the framework.

### Why is the information gathered useful ?
___
This part of the recon makes it worth the effort and time spent on the information gathering rather than directly hacking the system. Now it is pretty clear to everybody that hacking is illegal irrespective of the country you belong to and thus directly hacking the organisation might leave you in jeopardy and present your crime in the court of law. 

To avoid this it is extremely important for the tracker to erase its presence in the attacked system after the deed is done, or have a backup option available in case anything happens during the hack to avoid the crime being detected. I know this sounds evil but this is what it is.

This is where the information gathered from a recon comes into play. Recon provides us the with the vulnerabilities of the system not just to attack and destroy it but also to come out of it successfully, as you have access to which ports/IP addresses are open to use, from the network map it is easy to find the number of routers and gateway points connected to server, this provides hacker with a threshold time to get out of the system incase the administrator launches the defensive blow from the organization's system to catch the hacker etc.  Now you know why recon if used and conducted properly can prove to be the golden snitch for a hacker.

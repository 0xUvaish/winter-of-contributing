# What is Vulnerability Analysis?

We all make mistakes, we are human and because software is written by humans, it inevitably contains bugs. While many bugs are harmless in nature, some turn out to be exploitable vulnerabilities placing the usability and security of the system at risk. This is where a vulnerability assessment or analysis comes in. A vulnerability assessment is an analysis of vulnerabilities in IT systems at a certain point in time, with the aim of identifying the system’s weaknesses before hackers can get hold of them.


## Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT):

It’s easy to confuse vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. Many security companies offer both, and the lines between them can be easily blurred.

The best way to tell the difference between these two offerings is to look at how the heavy lifting in the test is done. A vulnerability assessment is an automated test, meaning a tool does all of the work and generates the report at the end. Penetration testing, on the other hand, is a manual process relying on the knowledge and experience of a penetration tester to identify vulnerabilities within an organization’s systems.

It’s best practice to combine automated vulnerability assessments with regular manual penetration testing for greater system protection. However, not every company is the same, and naturally, when it comes to security testing, their needs are different.

## Purpose of a Vulnerability analysis?

There is a big difference between assuming we’re vulnerable to a cyberattack and knowing exactly how we’re vulnerable, because unless we know how we’re vulnerable, we can’t really prevent it. The vulnerability assessment goal is to close this gap. A vulnerability assessment tests some or all of our systems and generates a detailed vulnerability report. This report can then be used to fix the problems uncovered to avoid security breaches.

In addition, an ever-increasing number of companies depend on technology to carry out their daily operations, but cyber threats, like ransomware, can halt any business in an instant. Widespread appreciation that **Prevention is better than a cure** has led to growing importance of cyber security and demand for solutions ensuring their resilience. For example, more SaaS customers now require regular vulnerability assessments, and having proof of security testing can also help you to generate more business.



## Steps To conduct a Vulnerability Assessment:

With the right tools in hand, we can perform a vulnerability assessment by working through the following steps:

**1. Asset discovery** – First, we need to decide what do we want to scan, which isn’t always as simple as it sounds. One of the most common cyber security challenges facing organizations is a lack of visibility into their digital infrastructure and its connected devices. Some reasons for this include:
   - Mobile Devices: Smartphones, laptops, and similar devices are designed to disconnect and reconnect frequently from the office, as well as employee’s homes and often other remote locations.
   - IoT Devices: IoT devices are part of the corporate infrastructure but may be connected primarily to mobile networks.
   - Cloud-Based Infrastructure: Cloud services providers make it easy to spin up new servers as needed without IT involvement.

We’d all love to work in an organisation that was perfectly organised, but the reality is often messier. It can be hard simply to keep track of what different teams are putting online, or changing, at any given point. This lack of visibility is problematic because it’s difficult to secure what you can’t see. Luckily, the discovery aspect of this process can be largely automated. For example, some modern vulnerability assessment tools can perform discovery on public-facing systems and connect directly to cloud providers to identify cloud-based infrastructure.

**2. Prioritisation** – Once we know what we’ve got, the next question is whether we can afford to run a vulnerability assessment on all of it. In a perfect world, we would be running a vulnerability assessment regularly on all of our systems. However, vendors often charge per-asset, so prioritisation can help where budgets can’t cover every asset the company owns. Some examples of where we may wish to prioritise are:
   - Internet-facing servers
   - Customer-facing applications
   - Databases containing sensitive information

It’s worth noting that the two of the most common vectors for untargeted or mass attacks are:
   - Internet facing systems
   - Employee laptops (via phishing attacks)

So if we can’t afford anything else, we at least try to get these covered, in the same order.



**3. Vulnerability scanning** – Vulnerability scanners are designed to identify known security weaknesses and provide guidance on how to fix them. Because these vulnerabilities are commonly publicly reported, there is a lot of information available about vulnerable software. Vulnerability scanners use this information to identify vulnerable devices and software in an organization’s infrastructure. The scanner initially sends probes to systems to identify:
   - Open ports & running services 
   - Software versions
   - Configuration settings

</div>

Based on this information, the scanner can often identify many known vulnerabilities in the system being tested.  

In addition, the scanner sends specific probes to identify individual vulnerabilities which can only be tested by sending a safe exploit that proves the weakness is present. These types of probes may identify common vulnerabilities such as ‘Command Injection’ or ‘Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)’, or the use of default usernames and passwords for a system.

Depending on the infrastructure that we’re scanning, the vulnerability scan may take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.



**4. Result Analysis and Remediation** – After the vulnerability scan is complete, the scanner provides an assessment report.  When reading and developing remediation plans based on this report, we should consider the following:

   - Severity: A vulnerability scanner should label a potential vulnerability based upon its severity. When planning for remediation, focus on the most severe vulnerabilities first, but avoid ignoring the rest forever. It’s not uncommon for hackers to chain several mild vulnerabilities to create an exploit. A good vulnerability scanner will suggest timelines for when to fix each issue.

   - Vulnerability Exposure: Remembering the prioritisation above - not all vulnerabilities are on public-facing systems. Internet-facing systems are more likely to be exploited by any random attacker scanning the internet, making them a higher priority for remediation. After that, we’ll want to prioritise any employee laptops with vulnerable software installed. Additionally, any systems that host particularly sensitive data, or could adversely affect our business may need to be prioritised ahead of others.

In most cases, there is a publicly released patch to correct a detected vulnerability, but it can often require a configuration change or other workaround too. After applying a fix, it’s also a good idea to rescan the system to ensure the fix was applied correctly. If it isn’t, the system may still be vulnerable to exploitation.

When we consider the number of vulnerabilities that exist and the complexity of the average commercial digital infrastructure, we begin to understand the scope for exposure and exploitation.

**5. Continuous Cyber Security** – A vulnerability scan provides a point in time snapshot of the vulnerabilities present in an organization’s digital infrastructure. However, new deployments, configuration changes, newly discovered vulnerabilities, and other factors can quickly make the organization vulnerable again. For this reason, we must make vulnerability management a continuous process rather than a one-time exercise.

Since many vulnerabilities are introduced when software is developed, the most progressive software development companies integrate automated vulnerability assessments into their continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This allows them to identify and fix vulnerabilities before software is released, avoiding the potential for exploitation and the need to develop and ship patches for vulnerable code.



## To Conclude:

Regular vulnerability assessments are critical to a strong cyber security posture. The sheer number of vulnerabilities that exist and the complexity of the average company’s digital infrastructure mean an organization is almost guaranteed to have at least one unpatched vulnerability that places it at risk. Finding these vulnerabilities before an attacker does can mean the difference between a failed attack and a costly and embarrassing data breach or ransomware infection.

One of the great things about vulnerability assessments is that we can do it ourself and even automate the process. By getting the right tools and performing regular vulnerability scans, we can dramatically decrease our cyber security risks.

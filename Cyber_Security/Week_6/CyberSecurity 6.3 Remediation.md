# Remediaton under Vulnerability

## What is Vulnerability Remediation?

Vulnerability remediation refers to the patching or fixing of cybersecurity weakness or attacks that are detected in an enterprise assets, networks or any applications. It used to be a manual process, but today it is more automated thanks to the advancements in data science, threat intelligence, and predictive algorithms.

## Why is vulnerability remediation important?
With the increase in volume of data and as IT infrastructures become more and more intricate and complex, vulnerabilities keep coming up. So vulnerability remediation has never been more important. 
Remediating vulnerabilities early on helps reduce the risk of breaches, denial of service attacks (DDoS), and interruption in operations caused by ransomware. 
Vulnerability remediaton is not only important but its oftenly mandated by various government regulations and industry standards. For example online payment or card payment businesses that handle any kind of payment related informatin are required to maintain and remediation and vulnerability monitoring program.

## What are the challenges of vulnerability remediation?

1. What are the tools available to help you prioritize vulnerabilities so we can remediate them based on our resources and organization's tolerance for risk?
2. How can we efficiently remediate those vulnerabilities.
3. How can one determine which vulnerabilities are likely to be exploited by hackers and which ones to fix first.

## Steps of vulnerability remediation process

1. Find: Finding and detecting vulnerabilities through scanning and testing.
2. Prioritize: Assessing and understanding which vulnerabilities pose a real and signigicant risk and which ones to deal with first.
3. Fix: Patching, blocking and fixing vulnerabilities at scale and in real time.
4. Monitor: Automating the code to discover and fix new vulnerabilities that are created in the future.

#  ___COVERING TRACKS___


Covering tracks is the 'final step' of penetration testing and it's aim is to erase, avoid every presence and detection
of themselve, so that no one or any investigator can track them.<br>

Covering tracks takes real time measures and detections to prevent from getting tracked.<br>
And also it is the prevention of leaving any kind of digital evidence, well known as anti forensic.br>

Now Covering tracks can be disabled using:<br>

-Disable auditing.<br>
>>As soon as the attacker gets the admininstrator privilege, it'll disable auditing(inspection), and when their work gets finished, they enable it, so they wont get any
kind of suspicion that someone took and looked inside their system.<br>

-Clearing logs.
>> Attackers, clear log from every possible places, so as not to get tracked by the investigator, and use different techniques so as to remove logs.<br>

-Modifying logs and registry files.
>> If the logs which are unable to get disable or removed, then the attacker modify the log, or even if they want to inject any malware, they change or modify the log.

-Removing created files and folders
>> After finishing their work and their aim, attacker remove every files and folders, created by them, so as not to let know the user or give them any kind of suspicion, that their system was used by anyone or the admin privilege was changed.


Attackers do delete their every kind of presence, keeping in mind of every aspects and, also hide some malware, so as to track or do some malicious activity.<br>
These were the ways, through which an attacker cover their tracks to remove there presence from the system.

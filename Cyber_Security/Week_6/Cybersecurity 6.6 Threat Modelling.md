Threat Modeling includes the identfication, Communication, Understanding threats and mitigations within the environment.

A threat model is an organized representation of all the data that influences the security of an application. In substance, it may be a view of the application and its environment through the lens of security.

Threat modeling can be connected to a comprehensive run of things, counting software, applications, frameworks, networks, distributed systems, Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets, and trade processes.

A threat model ordinarily includes: 
<ul>
  <li>Thorough understanding of the project that is modeled.</li>
  <li>Assumptions that can be checked or challenged within the future as the threat scene changes</li>
  <li>Potential threats to the system </li>
  <li>Actions to mitigate each threat </li>
  <li>A way of approving the model and dangers, and confirmation of victory of activities taken</li>
</ul>

Risk/Threat modeling is preparation for capturing, organizing, and analyzing all of this data. Connected to the program, it empowers educated decision-making almost application security risks. In expansion 
to creating a show, ordinary risk modeling endeavors moreover create a prioritized list of security advancements to the concept, prerequisites, plan, or execution of an application.


### Objectives

Threat modeling is a family of activities for improving security by recognizing dangers and characterizing countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the impacts of hazards to the system. A risk could be a potential or undesirable event that will be harmful (such as DoS assault) or coincidental (disappointment of a Storage Device). Risk modeling is an arranged movement for distinguishing and surveying application dangers and vulnerabilities.

### Its LifeCycle

Threat modeling is best connected persistently all through a software development venture. The method is basically the same at diverse levels of deliberation, although the information gets increasingly granular all through the lifecycle. In a perfect world, a high-level risk model ought to be defined early on within the concept or arranging stage, and after that, refined all through the lifecycle. As more subtle elements are included in the framework, modern assault vectors are made and exposed. The ongoing risk modeling handle ought to look at, analyze, and address these threats.

 It may be a common portion of refining a system for modern dangers to be uncovered. For illustration, after you select a specific innovation – such as Java illustration – you take on the obligation of recognizing the unused dangers that are made by that choice. Indeed usage choices such as utilizing customary expressions for approval can present potential modern dangers to bargain with.
 
 ### Benefits
 
 If done right, risk modeling gives a clear “line of sight” over a project that legitimizes security endeavors. The risk model permits security choices to be made reasonably, with all the data on the table. The danger modeling preparation produces a confirmation contention that can be utilized to clarify and guard the security of an application. An assurance argument begins with some high-level claims and legitimizes them with either sub-claims or prove.

* Asymmetrix cryptogaphy is a cryptographic contrivance that uses two keys --> one **public** and one **private key**, which are mathematically and empirically related to one another. 

* They're primarily used to encrypt a message (process of converting **plaintext** to **cipher**) and also decrypting it (reverse process of conversion from cipher to plaintext). 

* This way it can protect sensitive, confidential information from getting obtained by malicious elements as they're meant for specific recipients.

* A sender (of information/message) uses the public key corresponding to the private key of the recipient to relay the message/information.

* It is imperative to note that even though public and private keys are algorithmically related to each other, one cannot simply deduce private key from the public key.

* It also works with **digital signatures**, wherein a sender can use his/her own private key to encrypt a message which can be consequently verified using the public key, which is given to others.

* These keys are a lot longer than the symmetric keys and the longer the key-length is, the more difficult it is for the hackers to breach security.

# **A Simple Example:**

* The keys are typically generated by using large random prime numbers of equal length.

* Let's say we choose **p** & **q** (the random prime numbers) as 23 & 31 {we've taken small numbers in this case, purely for illustrative purpose}. Now we multiply them to obtain n, the RSA key modulus, which in this case would be 23 x 31 = 713.

* Now, we've to randomly choose the public exponent **e**, such that **e** & **(p-1)(q-1)** are relatively prime. For the uninitiated, two numbers are relatively prime if they have no common factors, except 1. 

* (p-1)(q-1) = (23-1).(31-1) = 22 x 30 = 660. So for this choose **e = 19**.

* **e = 19 and n = 713** will be collectively known as the ***public key***.

* Following this we can compute the private key **d** where **d = e^-1 mod((p-1)(q-1))**.

* d = (19^-1).(22x30) = 139.

* Hence, **d = 139** becomes the ***private key***.

# **Pros:**

* It overcomes one major problem that was introduced in case of symmetric key cryptography --> key-exchange issue.

* Another major advantages is that one doesn't need to ever reveal the private key to the sender, which enhances security as opposed to symmetric key's methodology of sharing the secret key.

* Can give digital signatures which can be revoked if desired.

* It allows non-repudiation, which means that after someone officially signs a message and sends it that person can never be able to deny having sent the message/information. This ensures integrity clause.

* Using digital signature on documents is like using a fingerprint, which will ensure non-tampering and integrity of data, and also allows verification that it has been sent from a particular user.

# **Cons:**

* It is much slower than the symmetric alternative, due to greater complexity of encryption algorithms used and key length and therefore, oftentimes not suitable for decrypting bulk messages.

* In the event of discovery of one's private key, it leaves that person vulnerable as the attacker will then gain access to messages sent by that person, constituting a blatant security drawback.

* There is no mechanism of knowing or authenticating public key beforehand, so an individual will have to verify whether a public key belongs to him/her or not.

* When one loses the private key, there is no way to decrypt the messages received and it can be concluded that the messages/information are lost forever.

* Proper key management is essential, as one of the keys is public, so businesses must enforce a PKI (public key infrastructure) to manage the certificates through CA (certificates authority), which incurs more expenses.

Internet and Communication Technology today has become an integral party of everybody's life. Therefore, ensuring security of information communicated over private and public channel has turned up to be the most integral part of any IT system. If the app or website or the technolofy is not secure, then it has very low chances of doing good in the market in terms of sell as well as usability.

### How to implement security
---
To secure the information communicated over private and public channels, the program has to ensure encryption at the sender's side and decryption as the receiver's side to happen with less chances of attack or information leak.

**Encryption:** The process of converting information from human-readable or plaintext format to ciphertext is known as encryption. This helps to secure the real message from attackers and eavesdropper. 

**Decryption:** The process of converting the received ciphertext to plaintext is known an decryption.

Encryption and Decryption both are performed using similar cryptographic techniques on both the sides of the communication channel. These cryptographic techniques are subject to change with regards to kind of information that needs to be encrypted and decrypted. Thus wide range of algortihms are used for this process and ***XOR Encryption*** is one of them.

XOR encryption was first implemented by the [Naziz'z during the World War II](https://www.forbes.com/sites/extrahop/2019/09/26/how-decryption-helped-beat-the-nazis-and-what-it-means-for-infosec-today/) for secure  commuication in letters, with a truely random key for each word that was hard to crack.

### What is XOR Encrpytion?

[![XOR-encryption-process.png](https://i.postimg.cc/65jS577G/XOR-encryption-process.png)](https://postimg.cc/N5Xbdjkg)
**XOR** (pronounced as "exclusive OR") also known as  **modulus 2 addition or subtraction operation**, is simple bitwise operation function that applies XOR operator to every character using the given key.

**XOR operator truth table**
|A      | B       | A XOR B|
|-------|---------|--------|
|0      | 0       | 0      |
|0      |1        | 1      |
|1      |0        | 1      |
|1      |1        | 0      |

Thus it is evident from the above table that when you XOR two strings charaterwise, if the bit of the binary value of the character is same, then the answer is **'0'** and if the inputs are different then the answer is **"1"**. Using the same concept as mentioned above, XOR encryption and decryption is carried out.

### How to implement XOR Encryption
----
The parameters that are required as an input for the whole process are:
1. Plaintext message (the text which has to be encrypted)
2. Encryption Key (Uniques byte of text which is used to encrypt the message and it can be of any defined length)

It is clearly visible that the information can be either in the image format(graphics) or text format. In case of text format the computer architecture has a predefined set of ASCII values and their binary tranformation to compute bitwise operators easily.
In case of an image based input message the image is converted in the grayscale format and then all the **black pixels are termed as 0** and all the **white pixels are termed as 1** in a matrix. Then using the matrix alegbra both the matrix are XOR'ed to generate ciphertext.

#### Encryption Process
* Convert every character of the message from its ASCII value to its binary equivalent and repeat the same process for the encrpytion key or take the input of the encryption key in the binary format only
* Align the plaintext and the encryption key in such a way that we can apply bitwise operation bit by bit and here one can use the [repeating key concept](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encrypt-using-xor-cipher-with-repeating-key/) if needed.
* XOR the plaintext and the encryption key to generate the ciphertext.
* Save the ciphertext in an array to send it to receiver.
* On the receiver's side fetch the ciphertext, align it with the same encrpytion key and apply the XOR function.
* The output of this process on the receiver's side will fetch you the correct plaintext again.

#### Code: XOR Encryption using Pyhton
 ```python
 # Programming language used is python
from __future__ import print_function,unicode_literals
from os import urandom

#Generating a random key equal to the lenght of the message
def generatekey(length: int) ->bytes:
    return urandom(length)
    
#Defining the encryption and decrption function
def xorencrypt(input,key) -> bytes:
    if isinstance(input,str):
        return b"".join(chr(ord(a) ^ ord(b)) for a,b in zip(input,key)) #Applying XOR method
    else:
        return bytes([a ^b for a,b in zip(input,key)])

inputstring = "I want to encrypt this message" # Message for encryption
print("Sender's Message:" , inputstring)
print('\n')

ekey = generatekey(len(inputstring)) # generating key equal to the length of message/.
print("Key:",ekey)
print('\n')

#Encrypting the message
ciphertext = xorencrypt(inputstring.encode('utf8'), ekey)
print('ciphertext:',ciphertext)

#Decrypting the ciphertext
print('decryptedtext:',xorencrypt(ciphertext,ekey).decode('utf8'))
print('\n')

#Verify
if xorencrypt(ciphertext,ekey).decode('utf8') == inputstring:
    print("XOR encryption successful")
else:
    print("XOR ecnryption unsuccessful")
```

### Advantages of using XOR encryption
---
* Since the length of the key is same as the length of the message it is hard to crack it using a brute-force attack. Thus if the key is **N bits long** there are **2 <sup>N</sup>** possibilities.
* Other logical operations such as **AND** or **OR** do not have such a mapping (for example, AND would produce three 0's and one 1, so knowing that a given ciphertext bit is a 0 implies that there is a 2/3 chance that the original plaintext bit was a 0, ***as opposed to the ideal 1/2 chance in the case of XOR***) and thus XOR operation has an equally likely probability.
* XOR encryption might not be applied directly,but it is an integral part of calculation in the AES Encryption algorithm and other strong cryptographic algorithms.
* XOR encryption can be extended to [graphical/barcode inputs](https://cryptosmith.com/2007/06/09/xor/) or [modified XOR Scheme](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270588628_AN_APPROACH_TO_IMPROVE_DATA_SECURITY_USING_MODIFIED_XOR_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM) or attached to [One Time Pad](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography_with_python/cryptography_with_python_one_time_pad_cipher.htm) for better security
* We do not need to code two different function calls for encryption and decryption process seperately, both the processes can be handled by same function.
* It is often implemented in computer malware to make reverse engineering of the problem more difficult

### Disadvantages of using the XOR encryption
---
* If the attacker gets hold of ciphertext it can implement [freqeuncy analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis) to find the right key that gives closeness to genuine english sentence.
* XOR operator is vulnerable to [known plaintext attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack) because plaintext **XOR** ciphertext = encryption key.

### Conclusion
---
XOR encryption is simple yet strong cryptographic algorihtm that is not just used to encrypt small messages and images but it can be used as the inital steps in larger algorithms such as AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) and much more.The basic idea behind the XOR operation is that without having knowledge of atleast two variable it is hard to decrypt the plaintext or find the key just based on one known variable i.e ciphertext. Thus with the advancement in technology, using XOR along with other cryptographic algorithms can prove to be extremely beneficial in terms of secruity.

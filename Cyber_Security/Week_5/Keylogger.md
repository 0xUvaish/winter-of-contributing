# What is a Keylogger ??

When you enter a password for the login screen on a website, whatever you type gets converted to bullet points, so no one else can see whatever you are typing. Is it true?? Well, it is not true if you have downloaded some keylogger without your knowledge.

KeyLogger or a Typist Recorder is a software program and a type of Spyware, which can record all of your keystrokes which you make on your computer's keyboard. Thus, without you knowing about this, your confidential data like passwords, username, credit card details, personal chat messages, etc, and other sensitive information can get into the wrong hands. These keyloggers run in the background in stealth mode and if properly made can bypass the antivirus detection too. Therefore, these keyloggers can be a serious threat to users.
Nowadays, Keyloggers are being made where they can even capture the screenshots of the screen of the victim.

A keylogger can be used for good purposes as well, finding evidence for a crime or monitoring employee productivity, or monitoring your child's activity on any electronic devices.

NOTE: Keyloggers do not affect the operating system performance. They are just used to spy on and monitor user's activity from the keyboard.
